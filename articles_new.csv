In order to properly prepare for the processes of AI implementation and to plan the path of digital transformation using the tools it supports, enterprises need to be fully aware of the factors that determine a successful implementation of the processes. The aim of this text is to identify the key determinants related to the adaptation of AI tools and technologies in business processes and operations of SMEs. Design/methodology/approach: In order to establish a catalog of adaptation determinants of artificial intelligence in SMEs, 24 deliberately selected academic texts indexed in the EBSCO database and published between 2021 and 2023 were analyzed. The research methods that were used are: an exploratory research approach and a single-step logical classification method, fulfilling the required criteria of exhaustiveness and separability in the selection. Findings: Using an exploratory approach to literature research, we identified 55 different factors impacting AI adaptation in SMEs, which we divided into the following seven categories, using a logical classification method: strategy and business model, culture and attitude, resources, support, entrepreneurship and innovation, competitive position and environmental conditions. Research limitations/implications: The research results have theoretical and practical implications. In the theoretical aspect, they can be a starting point for searching for methods to deal with identified determinants. In a practical aspect, the identified conditions may constitute a guide for SMEs planning to implement AI tools. A research limitation may be the fact that due to the dynamic development of the technological environment of SMEs, the identified catalog of determinants is certainly not closed.

SMEs currently face serious concerns regarding the pursuit of sustainability. Limited financial resources (FRs) frequently prevent SMEs from implementing sustainable practices. Therefore, these enterprises should mitigate expenses to invest in environmentally friendly initiatives. Enhancing resources and developing ways to accelerate Turkish SMEs' shift toward sustainability is vital. Moreover, adopting artificial intelligence (AI) and green innovation strategies (GISs) can boost sustainable competitive advantage (SCA) and lead them to success.

Because of unequal resource allocation, constraints on the intelligent transformation of SMEs in central China are different from those in economically and technologically well-developed coastal provinces. Hence, the authors focus on SMEs in central China to identify drivers of and barriers to intelligent transformation. Design/methodology/approach The interview data were collected from 66 SMEs across 20 industries in central China. To verify the validity of the data collection method, the authors used two methods to control for retrospective bias: multi-level informants and enterprises' AI project application materials (Wei and Clegg, 2020). The final data were validated without conflicts. Next, the authors cautiously followed a two-step approach recommended by Venkatesh et al. (2010) and used NVivo 11.0 to analyze the collected text data. Findings SMEs in central China are enthusiastic about intelligent transformation while facing both internal and external pressures. SMEs need to pay attention to both internal (enterprise development needs, implementation cost, human resources and top management involvement) and external factors (external market pressure, convenience of AI technology and policy support) and their different impacts on intelligent transformation. However, constrained by limited resources, SMEs in central China have been forced to take a step-by-step intelligent transformation strategy based on their actual needs with the technological flexibility method in the short term. Originality/value Considering the large number of SMEs and their importance in promoting China's economic development and job creation (SME Bureau of MIIT, 2020), more research on SMEs with limited resources is needed. In the study, the authors confirmed that enterprises should handle ""social responsibility"" carefully because over-emphasizing it will hinder intelligent transformation. However, firms should pay attention to the role of executives in promoting intelligent transformation and make full use of policy support to access more resources.",,10.1108/IJOEM-06-2021-0985,Intelligent manufacturing;SMEs;Intelligent transformation;Artificial intelligence;MIXED-METHODS RESEARCH;INFORMATION;FRAMEWORK;ROBOTS;ORGANIZATION;PERFORMANCE;GUIDELINES;CONSUMER;INTERNET;SYSTEMS,,,True,True,False,False

This paper will provide for an insight into and the premise for an upcoming study regarding the awareness, readiness and the capability of German SME to meet this challenge by taking into account their operational processes. It will also introduce the reader to the issues German SMEs deal with when preparing to join the wave of Digitization, Big Data Analytics (BDA), Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI).        The research presented in this paper was undertaken in order to answer the question whether German SMEs are ready for the upcoming challenges and the competition in the worldwide market. A first sign of the heavy interest for Digitization from the SME market was revealed during a short telephone interview which initiated the idea for a survey. The survey showed that nearly all queried SMEs are interested in the subject of Digitization, BDA, ML and/or AI and are willing to implement these innovative facilitators in their (daily) business models through e.g. bots and/or voice-operated machines. Nevertheless, even if there is the will in the market for the implementation of these innovations, it seems as if it - for a high proportion of German SMEs - will not be possible, due to insufficient funds, lack of work force and/or work culture to fully reap the benefits or even lay the fundament of these innovations.        The survey also brought to light that, in terms of a company's readiness, there is a huge disparity on a cross-departmental level in one and the same SME; while the marketing department might e.g. be ready and set-up with all necessary systems and datasets, the production department is not at all or vice versa. Therefore, it can be anticipated that even if all market participants want to join the 'lively debate' and be part of it, the actual readiness for subjects such as Digitization, BDA, ML and KI in German SMEs is still on ground zero and will involuntarily be on the agenda for the majority of these enterprises for the next ten to fifteen years.",,,Machine Learning;Big Data;Artificial Intelligence;SME;Data Structure;Innovation,,,True,True,False,False

With the digital transformation being one of the most discussed topics in the business world today, many decision makers - especially of small and medium sized enterprises - find themselves struggling with the understanding of new digital technologies and thus the potential benefits and risks for their companies. New technologies like the Internet of Things, Blockchain or Artificial Intelligence have great potential for businesses. However, carefully evaluating and selecting purposeful technologies - aligned to the digital strategy - is a major key to success. Technologies appear, change and also vanish so rapidly in the digital age, that a proper understanding is crucial for a sustainable technological foundation. Due to a lack of expertise and functions being less segregated in small and medium sized enterprises, in most cases the company owners are forced to gain a certain level of technology knowledge in order to be able to make well-founded decisions with respect to their digital roadmaps and thus the technological base of their companies.        Focusing on a digital way of knowledge transfer, the presented study examines the impact of serious games in the business context. Based on a state-of-the-art literature research, the application of serious games in diverse fields as well as the success factors are evaluated.

Smart technologies for SMEs enable allows the firm to get smarter with their processes and offers efficient operations. At the same time, it is needed to develop an effective tool which can assist small to medium sized enterprises to forecast business failure as well as financial crisis. AI becomes a familiar tool for several businesses due to the fact that it concentrates on the design of intelligent decision making tools to solve particular real time problems. With this motivation, this paper presents a new AI based optimal functional link neural network (FLNN) based financial crisis prediction (FCP) model for SMEs. The proposed model involves preprocessing, feature selection, classification, and parameter tuning. At the initial stage, the financial data of the enterprises are collected and are preprocessed to enhance the quality of the data. Besides, a novel chaotic grasshopper optimization algorithm (CGOA) based feature selection technique is applied for the optimal selection of features. Moreover, functional link neural network (FLNN) model is employed for the classification of the feature reduced data. Finally, the efficiency of the FLNN model can be improvised by the use of cat swarm optimizer (CSO) algorithm. A detailed experimental validation process takes place on Polish dataset to ensure the performance of the presented model.

The process to automate SME transaction execution is getting highly multifaceted as the number of stakeholders of SMEs is connecting, accessing, exchanging, adding, and changing the transactional executions. The balanced lifecycle of SMEs requires partnership exchanges, financial management, manufacturing, and productivity stabilities, along with privacy and security. Interoperability platform issue is another critical challenging aspect while designing and managing a secure distributed Peer-to-Peer industrial development environment for SMEs. However, till now, it is hard to maintain operations of SMEs' integrity, transparency, reliability, provenance, availability, and trustworthiness between two different enterprises due to the current nature of centralized server-based infrastructure. This paper bridges these problems and proposes a novel and secure framework with a standardized process hierarchy/lifecycle for distributed SMEs using collaborative techniques of blockchain, the internet of things (IoT), and artificial intelligence (AI) with machine learning (ML). A blockchain with IoT-enabled permissionless network structure is designed called ""B-SMEs"" that provides solutions to cross-chain platforms. In this, B-SMEs address the lightweight stakeholder authentication problems as well. For that purpose, three different chain codes are deployed. It handles participating SMEs' registration, day-to-day information management and exchange between nodes, and analysis of partnership exchange-related transaction details before being preserved on the blockchain immutable storage. Whereas AI-enabled ML-based artificial neural networks are utilized, the aim is to handle and optimize day-to-day numbers of SME transactions; so that the proposed B-SMEs consume fewer resources in terms of computational power, network bandwidth, and preservation-related issues during the complete process of SMEs service deliverance. The simulation results present highlight the benefits of B-SMEs, increases the rate of ledger management and optimization while exchanging information between different chains, which is up to 17.3%, and reduces the consumption of the system's computational resources down to 9.13%. Thus, only 14.11% and 7.9% of B-SME's transactions use network bandwidth and storage capabilities compared to the current mechanism of SMEs, respectively.",,10.1038/s41598-023-28707-9     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),,,,True,True,False,False

Unfortunately, small and medium enterprises (SMEs) making up more than 95% of all businesses is the hardest hit sector. This has urged SMEs to rethink their operations to survive through pandemic events. One key area is the use of new technologies pertaining to digital transformation for optimizing pandemic preparedness and minimizing business disruptions. This is especially true from the perspective of digitizing asset management methodologies in the era of Industry 4.0 under pandemic environments. Incidentally, human-centric approaches have become increasingly important in predictive maintenance through the exploitation of digital tools, especially when the workforce is increasingly interacting with new technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Internet-of-Things devices for condition monitoring in equipment maintenance services. In this research, we propose an AI-based human-centric decision support framework for predictive maintenance in asset management, which can facilitate prompt and informed decision-making under pandemic environments. For predictive maintenance of complex systems, an enhanced trust-based ensemble model is introduced to undertake imbalanced data issues. A human-in-the-loop mechanism is incorporated to exploit the tacit knowledge elucidated from subject matter experts for providing decision support. Evaluations with both benchmark and real-world databases demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework for addressing imbalanced data issues in predictive maintenance tasks.

Scales used to gather data were operationalized from previous research studies. A structural equation modeling (SEM) path analysis was used to estimate the impact of customer-focus on the performance of SMEs.FindingsThe outcomes of this study indicate that customer-focus has a significant positive impact on SME performance, hence backing the current demand for investigating the distinct influence of customer-focus on SME performance. The results show that customer-focus has a positive and significant relationship with financial performance, customer performance, internal business process performance and learning and growth performance, thus supporting the literature on the positive impact of customer-focus on SME performance. Therefore, customer-focus determinants used in this study, including co-creation, networking ties, customer insight and artificial intelligence marketing (AIM), are critical to the optimization of SME performance.Research limitations/implicationsNotwithstanding the importance of this research study mentioned earlier, the study has limitations. Notably, the sample size of this study can be increased to capture SME respondents in other geographical zones that were not included in this study. Future research studies may address how business environment conditions moderate the relationship between customer focus and performance, and also the cause-effect of the relationship between customer focus and business environment conditions on SME performance.Practical implicationsThe practical implications consist of two main items. First, this study empowers SME owners and managers to develop a customer focus technique as a central strategic goal in their quest for SME performance optimization. Second, SME owners and managers should progressively exploit the four determinants of customer focus which include co-creation, networking ties, customer insight and (AIM in order to accrue important resources for effective utilization of their customer focus competences as a way to enhance their performance.Social implicationsThis study is targeted at the sound development of SMEs to bring about poverty alleviation and employment. Poverty, unemployment and poor living standards are recognized as vital social challenges in most emerging economies. The establishment of customer focus as an important strategic capability provides opportunities for SME survival, profitability and growth.Originality/valueGenerally, the findings of this research study provide a strong backing to RBV perspective and the proposition that customer-focus and its determinants (i.e. co-creation, networking ties, customer insight and AIM) should be acknowledged as a vital strategic resource for optimizing the performance of SMEs.

Our findings reveal that AI techniques significantly outperform traditional statistical methods in predicting bankruptcy, demonstrating superior predictive accuracy. Furthermore, our analysis highlights that a firm's position within the Global Value Chain (GVC) impacts prediction accuracy. Specifically, firms operating upstream in the production process show lower prediction performance, suggesting that bankruptcy risk may propagate upward along the value chain. This effect was measured by analyzing the firm's GVC position as a variable in the prediction models, with upstream firms exhibiting greater vulnerability to the financial distress of downstream partners. These insights are valuable for practitioners, emphasizing the need to consider specific performance factors based on the firm's position within the GVC when assessing bankruptcy risk.

By combining LCA with artificial intelligence and machine learning, many uncertainties in early stages of design can be prevented which directly contributes to the performance assessment of smart cities environmentally, socially and economically. The aim of this study is to demonstrate the use of Environmental life cycle assessment (E-LCA) in three different well-established industries of three different volumes namely: food, glass and plastics industries. Material and Energy Flow Analysis (MEFA) using Umberto Efficiency + was carried out initially prior to LCA using Umberto LCA + to establish the inventory. The LCA has been conducted according to ISO 14040/14044 standards. Cradle-to-Gate system boundary was set considering the transportation of raw materials, energy and waste handling. Each case study is regarded as a sample representing the industry's environmental burden respectively. The case studies are chosen with different production scale categorized under small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The case representing the food industry which is considered a Small Enterprise proved to have a higher equivalent carbon footprint than the Medium Enterprise concerned with plastics recycling which points out the importance of performing LCA on all industrial scales.

In the present study, the authors analyze, supported by the use of artificial intelligence, the environmental solutions implemented in selected manufacturing companies using the example of the Great Poland Voivodship. The companies analyzed were selected from different industry sectors and were of different sizes, divided into two groups: small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and large enterprises (LEs). The authors observed the environmental activities of these two groups of companies, paying particular attention to the differences that were evident. The study is based on a questionnaire survey. All survey questions referred to the life cycle of a product, ranging from design, production, and use to recycling processes. We discuss the environmental solutions proposed by enterprises of different sizes and at different stages of the product's life cycle. The goal of this study is three-fold: (1) To investigate the differences in the introduction of environmental issues in SMEs and LEs in the Greater Poland Voivodship, Poland; (2) to examine whether companies in this Voivodship are equally aware of the impact of their business activities and their products on the environment; and (3) to discover novel, more rapid, and simpler methods to analyze the environmental sustainability of companies, including efficient models based on artificial intelligence.

The application of digital techniques to companies has had an important effect on the way of living and working. The use of artificial intelligence (AI), virtual reality and robots, among others, is generating different work modalities, and, therefore, education and training. That is why it is intended, from now on, that I4.0 focus on people and sustainability, which is beginning to be known as Industry 5.0 (I5.0). The aim of this work is to be able to answer two important questions: what obstacles to the implementation of AI face SMEs in the manufacturing sector and what requirements they must meet to adopt it. For this purpose, a bibliographic review and five qualitative studies were carried out in Argentina.",,10.1007/978-3-031-70465-9_18     WE  - Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Industry 5.0;Manufacturing;Qualitative survey;CHALLENGES,,,True,True,False,False

This study reviews the intelligent robot operating system based on SCF management and analyzes in detail the impact of digital inclusive finance on the innovation mechanism of green financial enterprises. Causal inference methods are introduced to construct one or more ""synthetic control"" units. These units are weighted averages of multiple control units, aiming to simulate the pre-policy implementation state of the treated unit as closely as possible, thus more accurately estimating policy effects. In the empirical analysis, based on detailed financial data of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) from 2015 to 2022, the relationship between the digital inclusive finance index and corporate green innovation is explored. In the analysis of control variables, enterprises' return on assets (ROA), auditors from the Big Four accounting firms (Big4), Book-to-Market (BM), enterprise size, and institutional investor shareholding ratio all show a positive correlation with green innovation of enterprises. Specifically, regarding the state of development of digital inclusive finance, the average of the Index is 0.213, with the median slightly higher than this value. This reveals that the development level of digital inclusive finance in the cities where most enterprises are located exceeds this average level. Regarding controlling the data results of variables, the enterprise size's mean value is stable at 21.989. The mean values of ROA, Big4, Research and Development (R&D), and BM are 0.044, 0.027, 0.025, and 0.783, respectively. In addition, digital inclusive finance positively impacts corporate green innovation. In small enterprises and the central and western regions, digital inclusive finance has a greater impact on green innovation. Therefore, the intelligent robot operating system has a wide range of application prospects in the digital SCF environment, which can improve the level of enterprise financial intelligence and promote the innovation activities of green financial enterprises.",,10.1016/j.irfa.2025.104112     WE  - Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Supply chain finance;Financial intelligence;Intelligent robot;Green financial enterprise,,,True,True,False,False

This paper empirically examines the impact of corporate application of AI technology on corporate ESG performance using a sample of 4858 listed companies in China from 2007 to 2022. The study finds that: (1) corporate application of AI technology can significantly enhance corporate ESG performance, and this conclusion still holds after a series of endogeneity treatments and robustness tests; (2) mechanism analysis shows that the degree of corporate digitalization has a positive moderating effect in the process of AI technology affecting corporate ESG performance. The channel analysis shows that the application of AI technology can enhance environmental (E) performance by strengthening corporate green technology innovation, social (S) performance by improving corporate philanthropic responsibility, and overall ESG performance with the above two sub-items as the main aspects. However, AI technology also weakens the effectiveness of corporate internal control, which leads to a decline in corporate governance (G) performance; (3) Heterogeneity analysis shows that AI technology promotes ESG more significantly in more competitive industries and tech-nology-intensive firms, and more significantly in the eastern and central regions than in the western and northeastern regions, and that large- and medium-sized firms are similarly superior to small-sized firms, while medium-sized firms have more room for upward mobility than large-sized firms, which embody a higher promotion effect than large enterprises.

For SMEs, owing to the inexistence of consistent data and other features, evaluating credit risks is difficult and costly. On the other hand, it becomes necessary to design efficient models for predicting business failures or financial crises of SMEs. Various data classification approaches for financial crisis prediction (FCP) have been presented for predicting the finan-cial status of the organization by the use of past data. A major process involved in the design of FCP is the choice of required features for enhanced classifier outcomes. With this motivation, this paper focuses on the design of an optimal deep learning-based financial crisis prediction (ODL-FCP) model for SMEs. The proposed ODL-FCP technique incorporates two phases: Archimedes optimization algorithm based feature selection (AOA-FS) algorithm and optimal deep convolution neural network with long short term memory (CNN-LSTM) based data classification. The ODL-FCP technique involves a sailfish optimization (SFO) algorithm for the hyperparameter optimization of the CNN-LSTM method.

Design/methodology/approachThis study employed a survey method to collect data from 225 food processing small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) on the Ghana Enterprise Agency (GEA) registered list in the Eastern Region of Ghana. The effect of marketing modification on the performance of SMEs in the food processing industry was evaluated using a structural equation modeling (SEM) - path analysis. FindingsAccording to the study's findings, marketing modification has a positive and significant impact on the financial performance (FP), customer performance (CP), internal business process performance (IBPP) and learning and growth performance (LGP) of Ghanaian SMEs engaged in food processing. The results of this study also demonstrated the importance of marketing modification determinants, such as marketing resources (MR), cross-functional and interenterprise collaboration (CFIEC), architectural marketing capability (AMC) and marketing strategy decision implementation (MSDI), in achieving food processing SME performance in Ghana. Research limitations/implicationsThis current research has its limitation, even though its importance has been mentioned earlier. First, the study can be improved by expanding the sample size through the inclusion of other SMEs from other industries since it is industry specific (i.e. food processing SME). Second, this current study was conducted in Ghana. To compare results, the current study may be replicated in other emerging countries. Third, future research studies may consider how business environmental factors such as technological change (e.g. use of artificial intelligence and machine learning) moderate the relationship between marketing modification and SME performance. Practical implicationsThe outcomes of this research study are anticipated to give profitable implications to both academicians and practitioners. For the academic aspect, this study provides an important contribution to marketing modification and performance literature by examining the impact of innovative marketing on the performance of food processing SMEs in Ghana. For practitioners, this study indicates that food processing SME owners/managers must focus on marketing modification to develop their performance. The increase in marketing modification application through marketing capabilities such as MR and CFIEC will enable owners/managers to achieve performance targets. Social implicationsThe application of marketing modification among food processing SMEs in Ghana will contribute greatly to their profitability, survival and growth. The growth and survival of food processing SMEs (not limited to food processing SMEs) in Ghana will help in the control of unemployment, which is a major social issue in Ghana. Originality/valueThe study's findings provide solid support for the marketing capabilities theory. This study also supports the notion that food processing SMEs should perceive marketing modification and its determinants (i.e. MR, CFIEC, AMC and MSDI) as a critical strategic capacity to enhance their performance (i.e. FP, CF, IBPP and LGP).

As a result, digital technology has emerged as the primary force behind industrial transformation and upgrading, as well as high-quality development. Using the data of Shanghai and Shenzhen A-share listed companies from 2007 to 2020, this paper empirically examines the impact of the digital transformation of listed companies on their stock price crash risk and its mechanism using a two-way fixed effect model with time and individual effects. It can be seen from the research results that, overall, enterprise digital transformation can significantly reduce the risk of a stock price crash. Further analysis reveals that this risk-inhibiting effect is more apparent for private enterprises and small and medium-sized enterprises. In terms of impact mechanism, digital transformation can reduce the risk of a stock price crash by improving the quality of enterprise information internally, while the more analysts pay attention to an issue, the more obvious the role of digital transformation in reducing the risk of a stock price crash for enterprises externally. However, it is worth noting that if the stock price of an enterprise crashes, blindly implementing digital transformation may increase the crash risk. The paper illustrates the practical importance of digital technology from the perspective of enterprises in stabilizing the crash risk of stock prices and improving the performance of the capital market. Meanwhile, it contributes to theoretical research on the impact of digital transformation on microeconomic entities and provides practical knowledge and evidence for enterprises to accelerate digital transformation.",,10.1111/exsy.13426,artificial intelligence;big data;cloud computing;digital transformation;share price crash risks;CRASH RISK;INNOVATION;TRUST,,,False,True,False,False

In this volatile, uncertain, complex and ambivalent environment (VUCA world), companies need responsible employees who recognise the individual need for action and initiate concrete measures early to increase a company's resilience. These measures affect multiple divisions. For example, disruptions in the supply chain are mitigated by various configuration elements such as expanding the supplier network or increasing stock in the company's own production. Therefore, measures encompass every element of the value network, whether in production or logistics. The example also shows that measures to increase resilience can influence other target characteristics of a company: Inventory increases can buy resilience at the expense of resource efficiency. Thus, measures must be defined for each design element depending on individual requirements in terms of resilience and must consider the scope for action of the respective company. This poses a great challenge, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Here, decision-making is done by generalists who often do not have the detailed knowledge for this specific problem or the capacity for this additional task. The danger is that SMEs will take insufficient measures that do not secure their future viability in a VUCA world. In this paper, a solution approach for a methodology is presented, that allows to derive influences on production companies from the developments in a VUCA world and measures to increase resilience can be identified depending on individual company characteristics. Furthermore, a possible conceptualisation of the methodology in an AI-based software product is presented, which supports SMEs in the outlined complex problem by enabling them to apply the methodology.

An approach to meet this demand is to democratize robotics by making cheaper more customizable robots that can be implemented by small and medium enterprises. To tackle this problem this research looks at using rapid prototyping techniques for the development of customizable robotic manipulators which can be implemented in cyber physical production systems. This research therefore contributes an approach for designing connected and rapid prototyped robotic manipulators. This approach considers both the software and hardware development required for implementing a robotic manipulator. Furthermore generative design, an evolutionary and artificial intelligence based approach, is used to design the link modules between the robot joints. This component has been identified as the ideal to be designed with this approach as it benefits most of the generative design approach coupled with rapid prototyping.

As a result of customization, the variety of products handled by a warehouse has increased, making storage location assignment problems more complicated. Different approaches have been proposed by researchers for improving storage assignment and order picking. However, many industrial practitioners find it difficult to adopt such approaches due to complexity and high associated costs. In particular, small and medium enterprises (SMEs), that generally, lack resources and who have staff members with weak artificial intelligence backgrounds, still rely on experience when assigning storage locations for diverse products. In these circumstances, the quality of decision making cannot be guaranteed. In view of this, an intelligent system which can be easily adopted by SMEs is designed to improve storage location assignment problems. The proposed system, an RFID-based storage assignment system (RFID-SAS), is a rule-based system incorporating radio frequency identification (RFID) provides decision support for storage assignment in a warehouse. Unlike many existing situations, RFID tags are attached to products at the item level instead of at the pallet level. As the knowledge embedded in the system is represented in the form of rules, evaluation is important and is outlined in this paper. The effectiveness of the system is verified by means of a case study in which the system is implemented in a typical SME specializing in machinery manufacturing.

Conversely, knowledge in AI applications is more beneficial for large firms. Artificial intelligence (AI) is often seen as a key technology for future economic growth. However, some firms may have an advantage in utilizing AI knowledge to create radical innovation. This paper investigates the influence of AI-related knowledge in firms on the emergence of radical innovations with a specific focus on the differences between SMEs and large firms. We find that application-related AI knowledge increases the likelihood for radical innovations, while technique-related AI knowledge decreases it. Nevertheless, SMEs have an advantage in utilizing AI techniques to generate radical innovations. Thus, the principal implication of this study is that SMEs should focus on AI techniques, allowing them to capture unseen technological opportunities which cannot be obtained in a formalized R&D process within a large firm.        Artificial intelligence (AI) is often seen as a key technology for future economic growth. However, its concrete effects on the emergence of radical innovations and the associated socio-economic impacts, through increasing divergence between smaller and larger firms, have not yet been systematically researched. This paper addresses this by investigating the extent to which AI-related knowledge influences the emergence of radical innovations and differentiates between SMEs and large firms. Based on a unique dataset of European firms combining firm-level data with patent data, we find a nuanced influence from AI. While AI applications assert a positive influence, AI techniques negatively influence the emergence of radical innovations. Being an SME significantly moderates these effects. Larger firms gain from AI applications, whereas SMEs gain from AI techniques. Therefore, AI knowledge in itself is not a general answer to increase the likelihood of creating radical innovation. Instead, a more differentiated view on AI is needed.",,10.1007/s11187-022-00698-3,Radical innovations;Divergence;AI;Artificial intelligence;Firm level;RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT;RESOURCE-BASED VIEW;FIRM SIZE;TECHNOLOGICAL DIVERSIFICATION;ABSORPTIVE-CAPACITY;KNOWLEDGE;PRODUCTIVITY;RELATEDNESS;EXPLORATION;PERFORMANCE,,,True,True,True,True

This study highlights the connections between these areas from the point of view of the management of industrial companies, revealing the challenges from theoretical and practical viewpoints. The most important questions are: On what level are organizations preparing for the digital future? What differences are perceived among the problems of multinational companies (MNCs) and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)? How do managers prepare for change and what changes are they making as they keep the concept of ""smart"" technologies in mind? This study highlights the results of a qualitative study conducted in 2018-19 using structured deep interviews with 195 higher leaders of MNCs and SMEs (NVivo 12 was used to analyze the answers). The results show that although managers see and feel the urgent challenges, they are not dealing with additional demands beyond technical developments. Handling of human problems is the most serious task; however, managers are continually postponing decisions related to these problems.

While increasing evidence highlights the influence of AITS on innovation and various economic and firm results, there is a notable gap of studies exploring the social, economic, and environmental sustainability pathways arising from the interplay between AITS usage and different types of innovation. This paper aims to address this gap. Additionally, the study investigates the moderating effects of the digital innovation strategy on the relationship between AITS and sustainability. Using a large, representative sample of 12,326 micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) across 29 European Union countries in 2020, and employing structural equation modelling with partial least squares (PLS-SEM), the research identifies multiple social, economic, and environmental sustainability pathways. The results indicate that economic innovation serves as a key driver of sustainability across all dimensions, positively mediated by environmental and social innovation and the adoption of AITS. Nevertheless, is particularly relevant the finding of a substitution effect between the digital and socio-environmental transitions. For European MSMEs, the digital strategy exerts a negative moderating effect on the relationship between AITS and social and environmental sustainability.

With increased popularity several financial institutions have begun offering SCF to businesses. However various recent scandals have highlighted inefficiencies in the evaluation of risks involved. In this paper we argue this is due to a mismatch between the firm-level features used to evaluate risk and what SCF is given for, which is a particular order. However order-level risk evaluation is difficult as companies do not wish to share their datasets with funders. Furthermore, Small-to-Medium Enterprises (SMEs) themselves may not have enough data to conduct order-level risk evaluation. We propose a Federated Learning (FL) framework to overcome these issues, opening up the possibility for order-level risk evaluation. FL allows collective, order level model training whilst preserving privacy of data owners. A case study in the aerospace industry indicates that FL can be applied to predict buyers' late payment risk with minimal performance loss.",,10.1016/j.ijpe.2023.109095,Federated learning;Supply Chain Financing;Privacy preserving;Machine learning;Artificial intelligence;Supply chain risk;CREDIT RISK;ENSEMBLE,,,True,True,False,False

However, the adoption of AI among MSMEs is still low and slow, especially in developing countries like Jordan. This study aims to explore the elements that influence the intention to adopt AI among MSMEs in Jordan and examines the roles of firm innovativeness and government support within the context.Design/methodology/approachThe study develops a conceptual framework based on the integration of the technology acceptance model, the resource-based view, the uncertainty reduction theory and the communication privacy management. Using partial least squares structural equation modeling - through AMOS and R studio - and the importance-performance map analysis techniques, the responses of 471 MSME founders were analyzed.FindingsThe findings reveal that perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use and facilitating conditions are significant drivers of AI adoption, while perceived risks act as a barrier. AI autonomy positively influences both firm innovativeness and AI adoption intention. Firm innovativeness mediates the relationship between AI autonomy and AI adoption intention, and government support moderates the relationship between facilitating conditions and AI adoption intention.Practical implicationsThe findings provide valuable insights for policy formulation and strategy development aimed at promoting AI adoption among MSMEs. They highlight the need to address perceived risks and enhance facilitating conditions and underscore the potential of AI autonomy and firm innovativeness as drivers of AI adoption. The study also emphasizes the role of government support in fostering a conducive environment for AI adoption.Originality/valueAs in many emerging nations, the AI adoption research for MSMEs in Jordan (which constitute 99.5% of businesses), is under-researched.

This phenomenon tends to homogenise recommendation results, i.e. popular products are widely recommended and non-popular products are under-exposed. The persistent presence of popularity bias in recommendation systems can lead to several negative consequences: (1) Consumers are unable to attain satisfactory personalized shopping experiences. (2) Small and medium enterprises are deprived of fair competitive opportunities, making survival challenging. (3) The user base of e-commerce platforms dwindles, leading to reduced transaction volumes. In this paper, we propose a multi-process fusion debiasing method. Convolutional neural networks are used to extract feature information to be embedded in the recommendation algorithm for pre-processing, in-processing and post-processing in turn to mitigate popularity bias and simultaneously enhance recommendation utility. The effectiveness of the proposed debiasing method is validated using the Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR) recommendation model as an example. Experimental results on two public datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms two baseline models and a state-of-the-art model. Specifically, compared to the traditional BPR model, the alleviation of popularity bias is around 70% to 80%, and the recommendation utility increases by approximately 30% to 50%.",,10.1016/j.elerap.2023.101323,E-commerce platform economy;Recommender system;Popularity bias;Artificial intelligence;Small and medium enterprises,,,True,True,True,False

In total, 35 semi-structured interviews were conducted with senior managers and owners involved in BIA adoption from 17 participating MSMEs.        Findings - The research study identifies three BIA adoption stages with specific technical and managerial features in the path of BIA adoption in each stage, corresponding to the level of BIA maturity of MSMEs. The authors also highlight other factors that directly influence the successful adoption and transformation from each stage to another.        Research limitations/implications - The research study identifies three BIA adoption stages with specific technical and managerial features in the path of BIA adoption at each stage that corresponds to the level of BIA maturity of MSMEs. Besides, this study also extends the current literature on BIA adoption in an organisation during the Covid-19 pandemic by identifying several contextual barriers that directly influence the BIA adoption.        Practical implications - Research findings can help business leaders and owners of MSMEs to determine the BIA maturity of their organisation. Furthermore, the authors' framework can also be used by consultancies and standard setters to develop detailed BIA adoption strategies and tactics that support MSMEs' digitalisation towards BIA adoption.        Originality/value - The research study's results highlight that contextual factors, leadership competencies, motivations and barriers for BIA adoption can also be used to help MSMEs' leaders and owners to trigger, advance or eliminate challenges for the adoption of BIA initiatives in MSMEs.",,10.1108/JEIM-01-2022-0037,"Business intelligence;Business analytics;Micro, Small and medium enterprises (MSMEs);Adoption;FIRM PERFORMANCE;ARTIFICIAL-INTELLIGENCE;ADOPTION;IMPACT;INNOVATION;QUALITY;DETERMINANTS;CAPABILITIES;SUCCESS;SMES",,,True,True,False,False

Artificial intelligence (AI)-based reverse logistics will help Micro, Small, and medium Enterprises (MSMEs) adequately recycle and reuse the materials in the firms. This research aims to measure the adoption of AI-based reverse logistics to improve circular economy (CE) performance.Design/methodology/approachIn this study, we proposed ten hypotheses using the theory of natural resource-based view and technology, organizational and environmental framework. Data are collected from 363 Indian MSMEs as they are the backbone of the Indian economy, and there is a need for digital transformation in MSMEs. A structural equation modeling approach is applied to analyze and test the hypothesis.FindingsNine of the ten proposed hypotheses were accepted, and one was rejected. The results revealed that the relative advantage (RA), trust (TR), top management support (TMS), environmental regulations, industry dynamism (ID), compatibility, technology readiness and government support (GS) positively relate to AI-based reverse logistics adoption. AI-based reverse logistics indicated a positive relationship with CE performance. For mediation analysis, the results revealed that RA, TR, TMS and technological readiness are complementary mediation. Still, GS, ID, organizational flexibility, environmental uncertainty and technical capability have no mediation.Practical implicationsThe study contributed to the CE performance and AI-based reverse logistics literature. The study will help managers understand the importance of AI-based reverse logistics for improving the performance of the CE in MSMEs.

SMEs, particularly startups, can obtain a competitive edge, innovate their business models, gain business value, and undergo a digital transformation by implementing these technologies. Continuous but gradual experimentation with these technologies is the foundation for their adoption. The experience that comes from trying new technologies can help entrepreneurs adopt new technologies more strategically and experiment more with them. The urgent need for an in-depth investigation is highlighted by the paucity of previous research on ChatGPT uptake in the startup context, particularly from an entrepreneurial perspective. The objective of this research study is to empirically validate the Generative AI technology adoption model to establish the direction and strength of the correlations among the adoption factors from the perspectives of the entrepreneurs. The data are collected from 482 entrepreneurs who exhibit great diversity in their genders, the countries in which their startups are located, the industries their startups serve, their age, their educational levels, their work experience as entrepreneurs, and the length of time the startups have been on the market. Collected data are analyzed using the Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) technique, which results in a statistical examination of the relationships between the adoption model's factors. The results indicate that social influence, domain experience, technology familiarity, system quality, training and support, interaction convenience, and anthropomorphism are the factors that impact the pre-perception and perception phase of adoption. These factors motivate entrepreneurs to experiment more with the technology, thereby building perceptions of its usefulness, perceived ease of use, and perceived enjoyment, three factors that in turn affect emotions toward the technology and, finally, switching intentions. Control variables like age, gender, and educational attainment have no appreciable effect on switching intentions to alternatives of the Generative AI technology. Rather, the experience factor of running businesses shows itself to be a crucial one. The results have practical implications for entrepreneurs and other innovation ecosystem actors, including, for instance, technology providers, libraries, and policymakers.

International trade supply chain financial services have played an important role in solving supply chain enterprise financing. As far as the energy industry is concerned, international trade supply chain financial services can provide sufficient credit support for energy companies. This solves the financing dilemma of small and medium-sized energy companies in import and export trade, and can also improve the capital turnover rate of large energy companies. However, because the international trade supply chain financial service still faces the influence of risks such as corporate credit risk, bank operational risk, and supply chain enterprise information transmission risk, its function of providing financing has not been fully exerted. Early warning and control of risks existing in international trade supply chain financial services can fully play the role of international trade supply chain financial services in promoting the development of the energy industry. Therefore, this article used three artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms, including artificial neural network, genetic algorithm and particle swarm algorithm, to analyze the risk of financial services in the international trade supply chain of the energy industry. A risk early-warning model about the financial services of the international trade supply chain of the energy industry was constructed, and an experimental study on the risk early-warning model was carried out. Research showed that the risk early warning model based on AI algorithm enabled banks to improve the accuracy of corporate credit assessment by 7.43% and the accuracy of information collection by 5.61%. It improved the forecast accuracy of external environmental risks by 3.52%, and reduced bank operational risk by 6.58% and legal and regulatory risk by 7.06%. (C) 2022 The Authors.

Although in high volume production advanced inspection technologies are in place, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) still often rely only on manual visual inspection by human operators to identify defective or improperly assembled products resulting in long cycle times, high error rates, and increased costs. To address mentioned issues, recently advanced automated optical inspection systems (AOIs) have been developed that employ Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) such as YOLO (You Only Look Once). While YOLO has been effectively applied to identify defects across a range of industrial uses, the potential of YOLOv8 for real-time detection of correct and incorrect assembly in automated production lines lacks research. The research presented here aimed to develop an automated optical inspection system using a camera and a CNN-based model, Yolov8, to ensure the product quality of the assembled parts in real-time. Three algorithms were developed using Python, RT Toolbox 2, and TIA Portal v17 to facilitate communication between the developed model, robot, and PLC as well as assembly and carry out quality control processes.

Moreover, this study explores the moderating effect of the breadth and depth of digital technology deployment on the relationship between ambidextrous innovations and the SCFP of SMEs.Design/methodology/approachA mixed-methods design is used, including a qualitative study and a quantitative study. Qualitative data have been collected from six multi-cases in different industries. Questionnaire data have been collected from 259 SMEs in China, and a multiple regression model is used to verify the research hypotheses.FindingsThe findings indicate that, in supply chain financing, both exploitative innovation and exploratory innovation are helpful in improving the SCFP of SMEs. For resource-constrained SMEs, a relative balance between exploitative innovation and exploratory innovation can help improve SCFP. The breadth of digital technology deployment can strengthen the relationship between exploitative innovation and SCFP, while the depth of digital technology deployment can weaken the relationship between exploratory innovation and SCFP. In addition, increasing the depth of digital technology deployment strengthens the positive correlation between the relative balance of ambidextrous innovations and SCFP.Practical implicationsTo effectively obtain supply chain financing, SMEs can either concentrate their limited resources on a single type of innovation or use relative balance strategies to simultaneously pursue two innovations.

The text mining and principal component analysis methods were used to measure enterprise digitalization and the level of enterprise resilience from 2011 to 2019, respectively. This study then explored the impact of digitalization on enterprise resilience. This research comes to three conclusions. (1) Digitalization can improve enterprise resilience significantly, but beyond the threshold, it inhibits enterprise resilience. In other words, there is an inverted U-shaped relationship between digitalization and enterprise resilience, and the steepness of this inverted U-shape shows a marginal increasing trend. (2) Notably, Resource allocation efficiency and information accessibility play a mediating effect in the impact of digitization on enterprise resilience. Further analysis found that the improvement of enterprise resilience is not only conducive to the growth of total factor productivity but also conducive to the high-quality development of the manufacturing industry. (3) The influence of digitization on enterprise resilience in areas with a high level of marketization, labor-and technology-intensive industries, and eastern and coastal areas is more obvious. The impact of digitization on the sustainable development of small and medium-sized enterprises, and private and foreign-funded enterprises is more significant.

It is unknown whether ChatGPT provides quality responses to infectious diseases (ID) pharmacotherapy questions. This study surveyed ID pharmacist subject matter experts (SMEs) to assess the quality of ChatGPT version 3.5 (GPT-3.5) responses. Methods. The primary outcome was the percentage of GPT-3.5 responses considered useful by SME rating. Secondary outcomes were SMEs' ratings of correctness, completeness, and safety. Rating definitions were based on literature review. One hundred ID pharmacotherapy questions were entered into GPT-3.5 without custom instructions or additional prompts, and responses were recorded. A 0-10 rating scale for correctness, completeness, and safety was developed and validated for interrater reliability. Continuous and categorical variables were assessed for interrater reliability via average measures intraclass correlation coefficient and Fleiss multirater kappa, respectively. SMEs' responses were compared by the Kruskal-Wallis test and chi-square test for continuous and categorical variables. Results. SMEs considered 41.8% of responses useful. Median (IQR) ratings for correctness, completeness, and safety were 7 (4-9), 5 (3-8), and 8 (4-10), respectively. The Fleiss multirater kappa for usefulness was 0.379 (95% CI, .317-.441) indicating fair agreement, and intraclass correlation coefficients were 0.820 (95% CI, .758-.870), 0.745 (95% CI, .656-.816), and 0.833 (95% CI, .775-.880) for correctness, completeness, and safety, indicating at least substantial agreement. No significant difference was observed among SME responses for percentage of responses considered useful. Conclusions. Fewer than 50% of GPT-3.5 responses were considered useful by SMEs. Responses were mostly considered correct and safe but were often incomplete, suggesting that GPT-3.5 responses may not replace an ID pharmacist's responses.",,10.1093/ofid/ofae641     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),artificial intelligence;chatbot;ChatGPT;infectious diseases;pharmacist;PHARMACISTS,,,False,False,False,False

Design/methodology/approach - The purpose of this paper is to develop a model to evaluate the innovative capacity of organizations based on fuzzy cognitive maps (FCM), particularly for micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs). The specification of the innovation evaluation model based on FCM was carried out with the ""Intelligent Decision Support System"" methodology. It is a six-step methodology: selection of experts, definition of concepts and relationships, model design, inference, interpretation and decision. Findings - Our approach yielded good results in three case studies, effectively determining the level of innovation in an organization. The fuzzy cognitive maps demonstrated a high level of accuracy, with an accuracy of 82% in the Colombian case studies and 92% in the global case studies. These results highlight the effectiveness of the model for quantitatively assessing levels of innovation within organizations. Furthermore, the study revealed the most influential and essential innovative activities/variables within organizations, contributing significantly to the improvement of their operations and competitiveness. Research limitations/implications - It is important to automate the definition of the relationships between the concepts of the context and of our FCM. It is also possible to improve the behavior of the FCM by analyzing the variables with a greater impact on the level of innovation and very dynamic in the context since they are the variables to be observed in real-time to follow the evolution of the innovative behavior of an organization. Practical implications - The study found that innovative activities emerged as an influential factor in organizations, essential to improving their operations and competitiveness. Our model can help in identifying areas that require improvement to impact positively organizations. By improving innovation assessment through the FCM model, organizations can anticipate higher profitability because innovations are often closely tied to revenue generation and cost savings. The tool can determine the necessity of new products or services, improve operational processes or enter new markets. Originality/value - The previous results in the literature show that although there are relevant advances on this topic, there is not enough knowledge to provide clear guidelines for evaluating innovation and improving performance in an organization using intelligent systems. Also, previous works have not defined a framework for evaluating innovation in MSMEs based on FCMs. They also do not use the data of an organization to assess the key characteristics related to innovation. This work applies FCM to automate the evaluation of the process and the capacity for innovation in an organization.

However, few studies investigated enterprise digital value creation. This study selects 404 Chinese SMTEs undergoing digital transformation and employs the technology-business-society (TBS) theoretical framework and necessary condition analysis and fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis methods from a configuration perspective to examine how six TBS-level factors, namely, basic technology application, data practice application, media attention, business credit, social responsibility and organisational resilience, interconnect and drive SMTE digital transformation value. Findings show that none of the six factors alone can adequately increase SMTE value. Rather, a combination of conditions with various configurations can increase enterprise value through digital transformation. Moreover, four configurations can increase value, namely, technology-business collaboration driven, technology led, technology-society-business balanced development and business-society collaboration driven. This study analyses the value configuration of non-high-value SMTEs undergoing digital transformation and finds that insufficient digital technology, media attention and social responsibility can hinder value enhancement.

Taking 81 small- and medium-sized listed companies as the research object, this paper chooses the small- and medium-sized listed companies in every quarter of 2018 as the research sample. By using the financial and nonfinancial data of small- and medium-sized listed companies and introducing the support vector machine (SVM) with the fuzzy method, the model of the fuzzy support vector machine (FSVM) is constructed. And the performance of the FSVM under four different kernel functions is compared and studied. At the same time, the performance of the FSVM is compared with other artificial intelligence models. The empirical results show that different kernel functions have different effects on the prediction performance of the FCM-SVM model. Under the Gauss radial basis function, the prediction accuracy of the FCM-SVM is over 86%. It can be seen that in predicting the financial crisis of small- and medium-sized listed companies, the FCM-SVM model with Gauss radial basis function has the best predictive performance. The FSVM model based on Gauss radial basis function not only has the advantages of linearity, being polynomial, and nonlinearity of neurons but also is significantly superior to the traditional artificial intelligence model.",,10.1155/2021/7819011     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE;MEDIUM-SIZED ENTERPRISES;CLASSIFICATION,,,True,True,True,False

In combination with the nature of assembly tasks, which may require high level of perception, skill, and logical thinking, these tasks are often conducted manually, especially in certain industries (e.g. furniture, power tools) or small and medium-sized enterprises. One of such tasks is the liquid level monitoring in gluing processes. Existing non-manual solutions are based on conventional and less flexible algorithms to detect the current liquid level. In production environments with highly individualized products, a need for more performant models arises. With artificial intelligence (AI) it is possible to deduct decisions from unknown multidimensional correlations in sensor data, which is a key enabler for assembly automation for products with high degree of customization.        In this paper, an AI-based model is proposed to automate a gluing process in a final assembly. Images of a gluing process are taken with a camera and a convolutional neural network is used to extract images features. The features are applied to train a support vector machine classifier to identify the liquid level. The developed model is tested and validated with a Monte-Carlo-simulation and used on a demonstrator to automate a gluing process. The developed model classifies images of liquid levels with over 98% accuracy.

CPS is a board range of complex, multidisciplinary, physically aware next generation engineered systems that integrates embedded computing technologies. Those integrated manufacturing systems usually consist of four levels: network, enterprise, production system and workplace. In this article we are concentrated to the workplace level, examining the implementation of the most suitable robot-cell and integration it into the production system and enterprise structure. The problem is actual for the big companies such as automobile industry, but very important is also for small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) that tend to produce for example; small tractors, air conditioners for high speed trains or even different type of doors for houses. In all cases the best solution to response the situation is the implementation of robot-based manufacturing cell into a production system, which is not only a challenge but also need a lot of specific knowledge.

In all cases, the digital twin offers manufacturing companies room for improvement in production and logistics processes leading to cost savings. However, many companies, especially small and medium-sized enterprises, do not apply the technology, because the generation of a digital twin in a built environment is cost-, time- and resource-intensive and IT expertise is required. These obstacles will be overcome by generating a digital twin using a scan of the shop floor and subsequent object recognition. This paper describes the approach with multiple steps, parameters, and data which must be acquired in order to generate a digital twin automatically. It is also shown how the data is processed to generate the digital twin and how object recognition is integrated into it.

The utilization of process data, which accumulates during production, is a critical component of this evolution. High potential is seen in the combination of artificial intelligence (AI) with this data to enhance plant productivity. However, these positive assessments are countered by the limited availability of rapid implementation options. Solutions ready for use in the realms of machine and process technology are predominantly offered by manufacturers alongside their respective systems. Consequently, complex AI projects often need to be executed as part of costly, individualized endeavors. For small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), these challenges pose significant financial barriers, particularly when the prospects of success remain uncertain.        Within the RECAST project, a framework that is both user-friendly and adaptable for process support has been developed.

Traditional methods for improving these processes based on historical data are becoming increasingly ineffective due to short product life cycles and small order quantities. The use of AI offers great potential for data-driven analysis and optimization of pick and stow operations.        Currently used AI algorithms focus on optimizing either pick or stow operations but not both in combination, missing the opportunity for holistic improvement of warehouse operations by reducing walking distances and process times.

The proposed architecture supports a range of intelligent components, including hardware (devices and sensors) and software (programs and algorithms), which facilitate the integration process without requiring extensive customization. The design aims to enhance older systems performance, connectivity, and functionality, providing a scalable and economical solution for upgrades, particularly suitable for Small and Medium Enterprises. Despite the potential benefits, retrofitting presents challenges related to overcoming inherent design or material limitations of the existing systems. Furthermore, regulatory compliance after substantial modifications, introduces additional complexities and costs, leading to potential unnecessary expenditures. The provided analysis suggests that while retrofitting is often cost-effective in the short term, the decision to retrofit should consider both the immediate and long-term strategic benefits of adopting new technologies, considering the full spectrum of operational and regulatory impacts.

This article examines the journey of an entrepreneurial firm's challenges in gaining higher global competitiveness by augmenting its current conventional strategic capabilities by adding AI to its existing capabilities. The focal case study also demonstrates that adopting AI capabilities (and expertise) needs pre-training to support its AI capabilities to predict focal artifacts or phenomena, to generate potent strategic solutions to resolve the challenges facing its clients, or to exploit potential opportunities. This research is based on an in-depth longitudinal case study of a firm attempting to add AI capabilities to gain higher global competitiveness for higher growth internationally. Initially, it attempted to identify the potential causes of defects in airplanes causing partial or total failure. Due to operational difficulties, it re-focused on two other opportunities, before achieving success in identifying the actual beginning and potential causes of pre-mature roof failures in high-rise commercial buildings in highly damaging and harsh environmental conditions that made repairing or replacing damaged roofs costly, dangerous, and time-consuming. However, it took the firm relatively long experiential learning to succeed in fine-tuning its technologies through pre-training of its AI capabilities to generate reliable results for saving costs, damages, discomforts, and time and generating higher values. The comparative and longitudinal analysis of the focal firm in this article points to the management of other successful firms in the AI industry posing to potent adverse forces, and insurmountable challenges for smaller entrepreneurial firms aspiring to succeed in gaining more competitiveness in the global AI industry unless they start prudently early on and upgrade their capabilities continually to remain competitive. The cautionary conclusion of this article provides both instructive and precautionary lessons for aspiring iSMEs in analyzing potentially difficult challenges before entering and committing to actively compete in the rapidly evolving AI industry, although AI-based generative recommendation can provide transformative solutions for resolving difficult challenges.",,10.1007/s10843-025-00385-w,AI;Competition in rapidly advancing technologies;Collaborative networks;Consumer/client perceive values;Generative AI;GPT AI;Machine learning;Technological race in newly emerging industries;Strategic pivots;FIRM PERFORMANCE;ORIENTATION;STRATEGY;TECHNOLOGY;KNOWLEDGE;LINKING;GROWTH;TRENDS,,,True,True,False,False

In terms of manufacturing production, AI-computer vision can replace existing rule-based systems and can add competitiveness to industrial sites. In order to respond to the innovative business management paradigm in the manufacturing industry, the advancement of smart factory construction in the domestic manufacturing industry is in progress. Accordingly, the introduction of manufacturing execution systems (MES) that apply AI to industrial sites is becoming important. In the context of manufacturing lines that operate under surface mount technology (SMT), the precise quantification of electronic components is crucial for ontime supply chain management and effective production output. However, small-to-medium enterprises often grapple with the lack of sophisticated systems for accurate part counting. Traditional X-ray machines operate on rule-based algorithms, engendering discrepancies in component numbers and engendering inefficiencies. Small object detection using AI deep learning is a useful technology in the production field and can be applied to various fields in the future. YOLOv5 is a fast, high -performance, one-stage object detection program. It uses pytorch, which is lighter than existing models and can be accessed easily by users. To better recognize small objects, we proposed the LyFormer model (LCTC, YOLO, Transformer), which added 1 layer to the existing YOLOv5 network, added 1Head, inserted a transformer module, and preprocessed the data with label normalization, correlation, local texture, and context feature maps. The proposed model is an improved model with better accuracy and speed than the existing YOLOv5 model. We took X-ray images of semiconductor parts, trained using the improved proposed model, and obtained excellent performance. It can be applied to the inspection process in the surface mount technology industry with many small devices in conjunction with production for the advancement of MES. The mAP performance of the improved proposal model was 0.672 compared to 0.399 of the YOLOv5 model, which was a significant improvement. The accuracy of the improved model was 0.915, which was a significant improvement compared to the result of the YOLOv5 model (0.602), and it could be applied directly in the field for object inference, as it could detect objects in reel units.",,10.1016/j.jksuci.2023.101859,Small object detection;Semiconductor;X-ray;YOLOv5;Artificial intelligence;LCTC;Transformer,,,True,True,True,False

Larger companies, especially machine and component manufacturers, already offer related products. Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in particular show interest in developing and offering solutions in this market themselves to gain economic advantages, to improve resource utilization of their machines or to be able to offer these advantages to their own customers. In the development process, however, they often encounter problems already in the digitization of the machines. The first hurdle is to obtain an analysiscapable data set. This is due to the fact that common and established general data mining development process models, such as CRISP-DM, do not focus on production technology, causing difficulties for engineers during deployment. A problem with existing process models is the limited practicality in the engineering domain due to restricted adaptability. In a previous paper, a guideline for engineers for data mining suitable digitization of production machines was developed in order to solve these problems. The related results were provided in the context of a project for condition monitoring of mixing machines. In this paper, the proposed method is applied to components of a 5-axis CNC milling machine in three different monitoring use cases.

This has led to the development of new scheduling models, such as Petri nets, time-augmented Petri nets, fuzzy scheduling models and neural net scheduling models. A fundamental objective of any scheduling system is event synchronisation and optimisation of command, communication and control C-3 between each active node of the overall CIM structure. CIM scheduling can be regarded as a nonlinear dynamic control process, whereby, the feed forward or feedback elements are the scheduling priorities that enable the manufacturing organisation to remain within a ''steady-state'' profit margin. However, in each different hierarchy level of the organisation, randomness phenomena in the C-3 environment can be observed, i.e. events in a particular department or organisational level cause a perturbation elsewhere in the manufacturing organisation. Furthermore, these changes are constrained by the framework of rules pre-set by the organisational structure and business corporate strategy. To a first approximation, these cause-and-effect phenomena can be viewed as deterministic changes which may result in ''deterministic chaos''.

In addition, it investigates the correlation between entrepreneurial orientation (EO) and AI in HRM processes. A survey was conducted with a sample of 310 firm members in the HR Section Romande, as well as a literature review on the adoption of new technologies. The results indicate a perceived positive value of introducing AI in HRM and a correlation between the level of a company's EO and the introduction of AI in HRM. This means that the more a company is entrepreneurially oriented, the more it tends to implement or include already implemented AI projects and tools in HRM processes.        The perceived value of AI in HRM was evaluated by comparing answers to research questions involving the introduction of AI in HRM tools, and expectations of widely implementing AI in the next five years. The main barrier of adopting AI in HRM appeared to be a lack of skills and training. In addition, potential features of implementing AI in HRM were identified as potential steps toward introducing AI as a new technology.

In preparing the book, we used Otter.ai [2] to transcribe interviews with three working professionals. These rough transcriptions, produced by algorithmic assistants, saved the team important resources, namely time, money, and attention.

In order to obtain a reliable prediction, of the operation of a Sustainable Manufacturing System (SMS) and its Social Return (SR), this paper develops a methodology and procedures that allow predicting the system performance as a whole. This will allow us to assist management decision making in industries 4.0, supported by multi-criteria methods in knowledge management, simulation, value analysis and operational research by means of:        a) Study the economic, social and environmental impacts in the organization and management of the efficient operation of an SMS with the selection of strategies and alternatives in production chains to minimize and / or mitigate environmental and labor risks.        b) Encourage of industrial symbiosis or eco-industries networks that create opportunities increasing eco-efficiency and the positive social return of production systems.        This proposed methodology will facilitate changes in the structure of production systems in order to implement industry 4.0 paradigms through facilitator technologies such as simulation and virtual reality. This framework will allow Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) and other companies to address the decision-making activities that improve the economic-functional efficiency, which will lead to reduce the environmental impact and increase the positive social return of certain production strategies, considering working conditions.

An emerging stream of studies has challenged this norm by demonstrating improved risk assessment and model prediction capabilities through unstructured textual corporate data. Fake online consumer reviews pose serious threats to a business' competitiveness and sales performance, directly impacting revenue, market share, brand reputation and even survivability. Research has shown that as little as three negative reviews can lead to a potential loss of 59.2 % of customers. Amazon, as the largest e-commerce retail platform, hosts over 85,000 small-to-medium-size (SME) retailers (UK), selling over fifty percent of Amazon products worldwide. Despite Amazon's best efforts, fake reviews are a growing problem causing financial and reputational damage at a scale never seen before. While large corporations are better equipped to handle these problems more efficiently, SMEs become the biggest victims of these scam tactics.

Small and medium-sized manufacturing companies are increasingly demanding smart factory solutions for quality control to create added value and enhance competitiveness. In this paper, we design and develop a high-speed defect detection system based on a line-scan camera using deep learning. The camera is positioned for side-view imaging, allowing for detailed inspection of the component mounting and soldering quality on PCBs. To detect defects on PCBs, the system gathers extensive images of both flawless and defective products to train a deep learning model. An AI engine generated through this deep learning process is then applied to conduct defect inspections.

As the world's largest apparel producer, China faces unique hurdles in terms of integrating AI technologies, highlighting the intersection of technological innovation and sustainability within this industry. In this context, this study aims to provide the initial exploratory correlations between AI adoption and open innovation from apparel manufacturing micro-, small-, and medium-size enterprises (MSMEs) managers' perspectives, identifying knowledge absorptive capacity (KACAP)'s significant impacts through an integrated and extended TAM-TOE model. We conducted PLS-SEM to empirically validate the antecedents of AI adoption and its consequential effects on KACAP and open innovation by collecting information from 269 of the apparel manufacturing MSMEs' top managers. The results show that the TAM-TOE structural model explains 60.7% of the variance in AI adoption, 47.4% in KACAP, and 55.4% in open innovation, which suggests that the model has good explanatory capacity, and that all these Q2 values indicate a sizeable predictive accuracy threshold. Drawing on the proposed model, the study has identified technological (e.g., perceived usefulness) and environmental factors (e.g., competitive pressure, market uncertainty, and government support and policy) that significantly impact AI adoption, while organizational factors (e.g., organizational readiness) directly impact KACAP, and environmental factors (e.g., competitive pressure, supplier involvement, and market uncertainty) directly impact open innovation. Subsequently, the AI construct is having a significant influence on MSMEs' open innovation through KACAP. This fills existing theoretical gaps by linking AI technology to organizational innovation processes and demonstrates the mediating influence of KACAP.

These radical changes, due to their deep transformations are denominated revolutions. The first industrial revolution spanned between 1760 1830 and the main characteristic was the jump from manual production to mechanical production. The second industrial revolution, took place between 1850 and 1940 and it was recognized due to the development of electricity. The third industrial revolution began in 1943 approximately, and the main technology was the computer. The fourth industrial revolution began in 2011 during the Hanover conference, and it became more important in 2016 during the world economic forum in Davos Switzerland. Its main characteristics are the combination of the physical and the digital world through technologies such as cyber-physical system, internet of things, large information processing, smart factory and cloud computing.        An actual research shows that in Colombia micro, small, and medium-sized companies MSMs-have problems with productivity, exporting capacity and customer service. The main cause for this is that these companies do not use modern technology to optimize their processes. This paper presents results of a research developed with 311 MSMs in Bogota. The type of research is descriptive. In order to define the sample, it was used probabilistic sampling, with 90% of confidence level and 5% of error range. For information collecting the instrument was a survey applied, directly in the companies. The aim of this research was to identify de current adoption status of fourth industrial revolution strategies by MSMs in Bogota, and then to have a base line that enables MSMs to be aware of the advantages and challenges of the fourth industrial revolution. In addition, the research proposes an implementation road map of fourth industrial revolution strategies for MSMs in Bogota. The results show that the MSMs in Bogota do not know what the fourth industrial revolution is about. The main technology used is cloud computing. A conclusion is that, the MSMs in Bogota are not yet taking advantage of the fourth industrial revolution opportunities.",,,Artificial intelligence;Cyber-physical systems;fourth industrial revolution;genetic engineering;internet of things;productivity,,,True,True,False,False

Financial distress (FD) is one of the numerous real-world applications of ML, struggling with this issue. Furthermore, the topic of financial distress holds considerable interest for both academics and practitioners due to the non-determined indicators of condition states. This research focuses on the involvement of balancing techniques according to different FD condition states. Moreover, this research was expanded by implementing ML models and dimensionality reduction techniques. During the course of this study, a Combined FD was constructed using five distinct conditions, ten distinct class balancing techniques, five distinct dimensionality reduction techniques, two features selection strategies, eleven machine learning models, and twelve weighted majority algorithms (WMAs). Results revealed that the highest area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) score was achieved when using the extreme gradient boosting machine (XGBoost) feature selection technique, the experimental max number strategy, the undersampling methods, and the WMA 3.1 weighted majority algorithm (i.e., with categorical boosting (CatBoost), XGBoost, and random forest (RF) having equal voting weights).

This article examines China's contemporary industrial, technological, and innovation policies within the context of global economic disruptions and domestic structural constraints. The relevance of this study lies in evaluating China's capacity to adapt to a shifting international environment, heightened technological competition from Western countries, and domestic pressures such as an aging population and slowing economic growth. The paper seeks to assess current strategies for the development of China's national innovation system (NIS) and critically analyze the transformation of its industrial policy. The central hypothesis posits that, despite outward signs of modernization, China's approach retains elements of traditional interventionism. Methodologically, the research draws on the theory of national innovation systems and elements of political economy, supplemented by case studies.These include an analysis of support mechanisms for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)-particularly the so-called ""small giants""-as a key example of the implementation of the ""national champions"" policy. The study relies on official documents and relevant statistical data. The findings reveal that China's current industrial and technological policies are marked by ambivalence. On the one hand, there is a notable shift towards a more nuanced and multi- tiered support system, emphasizing incentives for technology-oriented SMEs and the development of advanced sectors such as integrated circuits, artificial intelligence, and renewable energy. On the other hand, elements ofa techno-centric and mobilization-oriented approach persist, with ""national champions"" continuing to play a central role in driving economic development. While the definition of champions has expanded to include SMEs, and the criteria for their selection have become more flexible, the effectiveness of this policy remains limited. The case of the ""small giants"" highlights the risks associated with the new policy framework. Looking ahead, the Chinese economy and its technology policies will continue to face significant challenges. However, the potential for transformative change appears limited due to mounting external pressures and path dependency, which predispose Chinese leadership to replicate established approaches.",,10.24833/2071-8160-2024-6-99-133-148     WE  - Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),China;development policy;technology policy;national champions;small giants;national innovation system;matrix approach,,,True,True,False,True

By integrating statistical tools, artificial intelligence, and engineering design principles, alternative solutions were evaluated to minimize waste. This document contributes to existing knowledge by demonstrating the integration of an STNN with the Lean/Six Sigma framework in condiment production, an area with limited empirical research. It underscores the benefits of advanced AI technologies in enhancing traditional process optimization methods. The STNN model achieved 97.31% accuracy for temperature classification and 97.37% for humidity, outperforming a Naive Bayes model, which attained 90% accuracy for both.

Artificial intelligence may facilitate the movement of US for pneumothorax into the prehospital setting. The large amount of training data required for conventional neural network methodologies has limited their use in US so far.METHODS: A limited training database was supplied by Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency of 30 patients, 15 cases with pneumothorax and 15 cases without. There were two US videos per patient, of which we were allowed to choose one to train on, so that a limited set of 30 videos were used. Images were annotated for ribs and pleural interface. The software performed anatomic reconstruction to identify the region of interest bounding the pleura. Three neural networks were created to analyze images on a pixel-by-pixel fashion with direct voting determining the outcome. Independent verification and validation was performed on a data set gathered by the Department of Defense.RESULTS: Anatomic reconstruction with the identification of ribs and pleura was able to be accomplished on all images. On independent verification and validation against the Department of Defense testing data, our program concurred with the SME 80% of the time and achieved a 86% sensitivity (18/21) for pneumothorax and a 75% specificity for the absence of pneumothorax (18/24). Some of the mistakes by our artificial intelligence can be explained by chest wall motion, hepatization of the underlying lung, or being equivocal cases.CONCLUSION: Using learning with limited labeling techniques, pneumothorax was identified on US with an accuracy of 80%.

Yet, there is lack of information in the literature about how the use of AI within organizations and specifically in social enterprises (SE) will impact managerial skills and performance. For this purpose, we adopted a qualitative approach based on semi-structured interviews conducted with SEmanagers from four SEs that have already implemented AI and are using it already. The results were subjected to a thematic content analysis. The findings confirm that the majority of managerial talents will probably be enhanced by AI, while a small number of them (information collecting and straightforward decision-making) may be replaced or unaffected.

On the basis of previously developed Logistics 4.0 maturity model authors also propose Artificial intelligence maturity levels and on its basis a survey has been conducted in selected Polish and Norwegian companies and actual AI state of development and maturity levels has been recognized. However authors present preliminary stage of research as a multi case study which will be further developed and extended in order to identify branches and areas with a hugest potential to enhance AI utilization.        Furthermore paper presents potential directions of Artificial intelligence implementation as well as tools that can be useful to deal with big data and optimization problems predicted not only for big companies but also SMEs. Authors propose term Artificial Intelligence 4.0 to point out the actual trends in the scope of Industry 4.0 and Logistics 4.0 and revolution with respect to AI. Without doubt AI is a big challenge for manufacturing companies as well as Transport and Logistics Industry and its application should be increased and extended in solving practical problems.        Methods: Methodology applied by authors of hereby paper can be divided on following stages: literature analysis, enlargement of AI maturity model, development of a questionnaire, multi-case studies in Norway and Poland.        Results: The literature search showed a cognitive gap due to fact there is a little of literature dealing with problem of Artificial intelligence maturity models as well as Logistics 4.0 and Artificial Intelligence. Artificial intelligence maturity levels can be combined with Logistics 4.0 maturity models thus relations between actual level of logistics maturity and AI readiness in companies will be recognized. Due to such analysis it will be possible to develop complex roadmap with the organization's strategic guidelines how to deal with Logistics 4.0 and AI. All the companies investigated in this preliminary study could be classified as AI Novices: Companies that have not taken proactive steps on the AI journey and are at best in assessment mode. Even the bigger companies with more automated solutions cannot visualize the benefits AI can bring.

Hence, this work explores the evaluation issue of implementation barriers via an integrated decision model. In this model, the conventional additive ratio assessment (ARAS) model integrated with the Choquet integral and criteria importance through intercriteria correlation (CRITIC) is extended into the interval-valued Fermatean fuzzy (IVFF) setting for ranking the barriers. The IVFF weighted average operator based on the Choquet integral is introduced to form a group decision matrix.

The remarkable expansion of the embedded ICT market, together with the rise and breakthroughs of Artificial Intelligence (AI), have put the focus on the Edge as it stands as one of the keys for the next technological revolution: the seamless integration of AI in our daily life. However, training and deployment of custom AI solutions on embedded devices require a fine-grained integration of data, algorithms, and tools to achieve high accuracy and overcome functional and non-functional requirements. Such integration requires a high level of expertise that becomes a real bottleneck for small and medium enterprises wanting to deploy AI solutions on the Edge, which, ultimately, slows down the adoption of AI on applications in our daily life.        In this work, we present a modular AI pipeline as an integrating framework to bring data, algorithms, and deployment tools together.

Methods: This research is based on a random sample of 326 large enterprises and SMEs in Slovenia, with an entrepreneur completing a questionnaire in each enterprise. Results: Findings suggest that there are no significant differences between male and female entrepreneurs in Slovenia regarding various aspects of AI-supported entrepreneurial management practice including the following: AI-supported entrepreneurial culture, AI-enhanced leadership, adopting AI to reduce employee workload, and incorporating AI tools into work processes. The widespread integration of AI into entrepreneurship marks a transition to a business landscape that values inclusivity and equity, measuring success through creativity, strategic technology deployment, and leadership qualities, rather than relying on gender-based advantages or limitations. Our research also focused on the identification of gender differences in path coefficients regarding the impact of the four previously mentioned aspects of AI on employee engagement. While both genders see the value in using AI to alleviate employee workload, the path coefficients indicate that female entrepreneurs report higher effectiveness in this area, suggesting differences in the implementation of AI-integrated strategies or tool selection. Male entrepreneurs, on the other hand, appear to integrate AI tools into their work processes more extensively, particularly in areas requiring predictive analytics and project scheduling.

Acknowledging the MSME sector as a crucial contributor to the Indian economy and industrial development, the study delves into the assessment of MSMEs based on Industry 4.0 components. Additionally, it explores the profound impact of these components on various performance factors, including organizational performance, sustainability performance and human-related aspects. The paper further ranks these identified components based on their significance within the MSME sector. Design/methodology/approach - Employing a combination of methodological approaches, the research utilizes the Best and Worst Method (BWM), Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) and calculates the Maturity Index for Industry 4.0 components. The BWM, a recognized multi-criteria decision-making technique, is initially applied to determine the weights and rankings of the identified components. Furthermore, the study evaluates 30 MSMEs, spanning manufacturing and service sectors, through the DEA approach. Industry 4.0 components are treated as inputs, and performance factors serve as outputs. Data for the analysis are collected through questionnaires distributed to the selected MSMEs. Lastly, the Maturity Index for MSMEs is also calculated. Findings - From the result of the BWM method ""assistive manufacturing"" was found to be a highly weighted key component of Industry 4.0. From the DEA analysis out of 30 MSMEs 13 SMEs were highlighted as being efficient, whereas 17 MSMEs were judged to be inefficient. Furthermore, from the maturity index calculation, overall Maturity Index was determined to be 3.33 which shows that Industry 4.0 is in its initial stage of implementation, but it has gained pace in its implementation. Practical implications - The research contributes to practical implications by offering a more accurate assessment of the state of Industry 4.0 implementation within MSMEs. The introduced maturity index proves instrumental in pinpointing key components that have received inadequate attention. This information is crucial for MSME managers and policymakers, guiding them in allocating resources effectively, addressing areas requiring attention and facilitating progress in the implementation of Industry 4.0. The study serves as a valuable tool for MSMEs to enhance their overall operational efficiency. Originality/value - The research's originality lies in its application of a comprehensive approach, combining BWM, DEA and the introduction of a maturity index for Industry 4.0 components in the MSME context. By employing these methodologies, the study not only identifies influential components but also provides a nuanced understanding of their relative significance. The research contributes significantly to the broader understanding of Industry 4.0 adoption, particularly, in the vital MSME sector within the Indian context.

This project aims at the design of a system that is capable of harvesting tomatoes indoor in an autonomous way for an entrepreneur involved in Mauritius, who is currently facing various problems related mostly to a shortage of labour. The system was designed specifically for the company taking into consideration its requirements and constraints. The proposed system was a 3-axis robotic arm mounted on an Automated Guided Vehicle (AGV) capable of picking tomatoes using computer vision for identification and recognition. The spatial location of the fruits was obtained by means of stereovision, which is a technique consisting of two cameras viewing the scene from two different positions and then through triangulation, the real-world coordinates of the tomatoes were extracted. Using this information, the robotic arm was able to pluck and store the tomatoes. The AGV, on the other hand, was used to transport the robotic arm throughout the greenhouse and line following was employed so that the vehicle achieved an autonomous behaviour.

AI-driven GPI acts as a mediator between GEL and firm performance. We tested the research hypotheses using data from 255 Small and Medium Size Enterprises in China's Traditional Chinese Medicine manufacturing industry. The results indicate that GEL positively impacts AI-driven GPI, while GTT negatively moderates this effect. Moreover, AI-driven GPI mediates the GEL- firm performance relationship.

Load changes can cause system frequency fluctuations and may cause damage to electrical equipment. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is used to obtain the right constants to obtain the best optimization. In this study compare the control method, namely; Proportional Integral Derivatives (PID), Capacitive Energy Storage (CES), and Superconducting Magnetic Energy Storage (SMES). This study also compared the method of artificial intelligence between Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) method has been studied with the method of Firefly Algorithm (FA). Overall this study compares 11 methods, namely methods; uncontrolled, PID-PSO method, PID-FA method, CES-PSO method, CES-FA method, SMES-PSO method, SMES-FA method, PID-CES-PSO method, PID-CES-FA method, PID-SMES - PSO, and PID-SMES-FA method. The results of the simulation showed that from the 11 methods studied, it was found that the PID-CES-FA method has the smallest undershot value, ie -7.774e-03 pu, the smallest overshoot value, which is 4.482e-05 pu, and the fastest completion time is 7.11 s. These results indicate that the smallest frequency fluctuations are found in the PID-CES-FA controller. Thus it is stated that the PID-CES-FA method is the best method used in the previous method. This research will use other methods to get the best controller.",,,CES;Firefly Algorithm;micro-hydro;PID;SMES,,,True,False,True,False

One result of this are efforts towards more local production in micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSME) in order to make value creation cycles smaller. This enables environmental benefits such as shorter transport distances and closed-loop product life cycles, in addition to economic advantages like more independence from global trade and support of the local economy. But more individualized production and smaller scales increase product variety. Thus, to meet changing demands, local MSMEs will have to collaborate more, especially for complex products requiring specialized knowledge. As a result, MSMEs face a multitude of challenges, such as the planning of their production and especially of value chains across the network companies.

This study aims to explore key variables that affect green innovation, thereby promoting the sustainable development of organizations, and to investigate the incentive mechanisms behind it. By uncovering the internal and external factors that drive green innovation and their interactions, we can better understand and optimize the process of fostering green innovation. Unlike previous studies, this research not only explores variables and verifies main effects but also provides and validates a research model related to the occurrence of green innovation. Additionally, this study determines the extent to which artificial intelligence management influences green innovation through knowledge sharing and examines whether an innovative culture moderates the impact of artificial intelligence management and knowledge sharing on green innovation, as well as whether it moderates the mediating effect of knowledge sharing within the model. Therefore, this study collected data from 331 adult employees of SMEs across 23 provinces, cities, and districts in China and conducted empirical analyses, including confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and reliability analysis.

The first purpose is to characterize female users who use this platform to share content around this area. The second is to identify the most prominent themes among female users' digital production of gender inequality concepts, applied to AI technologies.Design/methodology/approachSocial opinion mining has been applied to historical Twitter data. Data were gathered using a combination of analytical methods such as word clouds, sentiment analyses and clustering. It examines 172,041 tweets worldwide over a limited period of 359 days.FindingsEmpirical data gathered from interactions of female users in digital dialogues highlight that the most prominent topics of interest are the future of AI technologies and the active role of women to guarantee gender balanced systems. Algorithmic bias impacts female user behaviours in response to injustice and inequality in algorithmic outcomes. They share topics of interest and lead constructive conversations with profiles affiliated with gender or race empowerment associations. Women challenged by stereotypes and prejudices are likely to fund entrepreneurial solutions to create opportunities for change.Research limitations/implicationsThis study does have its limitations, however. First, different keywords are likely to result in a different pool of related research. Moreover, due to the nature of our sample, the largest proportion of posts are from native English speakers, predominantly (88%) from the US, UK, Australia and Canada. This demographic concentration reflects specific social structures and practices that influence gender equity priorities within the sample. These cultural contexts, which often emphasize inclusivity and equity, play a significant role in shaping the discourse around gender issues. These cultural norms, preferences and practices are critical in understanding the individual behaviours, perspectives and priorities expressed in the posts; in other words, it is vital to consider cultural context and economic determinants in an analysis of gender equity discussions. The US, UK, Australia and Canada share a cultural and legal heritage, a common language, values, democracy and the rule of law. Bennett (2007) emphasizes the potential for enhanced cooperation in areas like technology, trade and security, suggesting that the anglosphere's cultural and institutional commonalities create a natural foundation for a cohesive, influential global network. These shared characteristics further influence the common approaches and perspectives on gender equity in public discourse. Yet findings from Western nations should not be assumed to apply easily to the contexts of other countries.Practical implicationsFrom a practical perspective, the results help us understand the role of female influencers and scrutinize public conversations. From a theoretical one, this research upholds the argument that feminist critical thought is indispensable in the development of balanced AI systems.Social implicationsThe results also help us understand the role of female influencers: ordinary individuals often challenged by gender and race discrimination. They request an intersectional, collaborative and pluralistic understanding of gender and race in AI. They act alone and endure the consequences of stigmatized products and services.

The emergence of digital financial inclusion has introduced a transformative framework to address this critical issue, offering new avenues for SMEs to access capital. This paper explores the dynamic relationship between digital financial inclusion and the funding constraints encountered by SMEs. Governments, recognizing the importance of SME expansion, have actively promoted regulations to incentivize financial institutions to adopt innovative service models and directly support SMEs. This paper delves into the multifaceted landscape of policy dynamics and its impact on SMEs, underscoring their pivotal role in the broader economic fabric. Recent developments in digital financial inclusion have combined technological innovation and deliberate policy measures. Incorporating artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms has significantly enhanced the accuracy of financial services, enabling tailored solutions for SMEs. The widespread adoption of mobile banking apps and digital payment platforms has expanded financial access, especially in historically underserved areas. Blockchain technology has introduced transparency and security to financial transactions. While existing research has highlighted the potential benefits of digital financial inclusion for SMEs, there remains a need for a comprehensive empirical understanding of the intricate relationship between these initiatives and the specific funding challenges faced by SMEs. This paper addresses this gap by conducting a thorough empirical analysis, shedding light on unexplored aspects, and providing valuable insights for policymakers and financial institutions. Our study's objectives are multifaceted. We aim to assess the impact of digital financial inclusion on SME funding constraints through a comprehensive empirical study. By examining pilot projects in specific geographic areas, we seek to uncover nuanced observations and disparities. Furthermore, our research enriches the theoretical framework by exploring the complex interplay between digital financial inclusion and SME financial viability. The findings reveal that while digital financial inclusion has the potential to alleviate funding constraints for SMEs, it faces challenges related to technical assistance, information disparities, and limitations in the magnitude and duration of funding. This complexity underscores the need for a nuanced approach to policy development and intervention, considering socio-economic factors and demographic variations. This study contributes to the evolving landscape of digital financial inclusion and its impact on SME finance. It provides valuable insights for SME managers and policymakers, emphasizing the importance of closing information gaps and offering a range of financing options. Ultimately, it calls for a strategic equilibrium between immediate and long-term funding choices to cater to diverse SME growth trajectories.

It is labelled as a general-purpose technology, as well as an invention of a method for inventing. Thus, AI is perceived to generate technological opportunities and through these, innovations, and productivity growth. The leapfrogging hypothesis suggests that latecomer firms can use these opportunities to catch up. The aim of this paper is to provide insight into this catch-up process of latecomer firms through integrating AI into their knowledge portfolio and thereby creating new technological trajectories. The moderating effect of firm size is also analysed. Combining firm-level data with patent data, a regression at the firm level is conducted. Evidence is found that smaller firms experience productivity growth from AI when operating at the productivity frontier, indicating the opposite of the leapfrogging hypothesis. However, there is evidence for the positive im pact of AI on firm innovation, which is higher for latecomer firms that are larger in size. In general, we find a diverging pattern of the influence of AI on productivity and innovation growth, indicating the need for a finer grained analysis that takes indirect effects - that also could explain the observed productivity paradox - into account.

In contrast, large latecomer firms experience a higher innovative productivity growth. These effects are dependent on the type of AI. Artificial intelligence (AI) is seen as a key technology for future economic growth. It is labelled as a general-purpose technology, as well as an invention of a method for inventing. Thus, AI is perceived to generate innovations and productivity growth. This paper investigates the influence of different types of AI on smaller and larger firms that are either frontier or latecomer firms. We find that smaller frontier firms experience a higher labour productivity growth while larger latecomer firms experience a higher innovative productivity growth. This diverging impact has implications for scholars, as it could partially explain the productivity paradox and shows the need for research on specific types of AI. This impact also has implications for policy makers and practitioners alike that aim to strengthen frontier firms or to develop latecomer firms.",,10.1007/s11187-023-00754-6,Artificial intelligence;Firm growth;Catch-up;Innovation;Productivity;LEVEL EVIDENCE;PRODUCTIVITY;INNOVATION;SIZE;TECHNOLOGY;FRONTIER;CONVERGENCE;PERSPECTIVE;OPPORTUNITY;PANEL,,,True,True,False,True

Developing an SMS is expensive and complicated, integrating together various technologies such as automation, data exchanges, cyber-physical systems (CPS), artificial intelligence, internet of things (IoT), and semi-autonomous industrial systems. The Small, Medium and Micro Enterprises (SMMEs) have limited resources and therefore, would like to see the benefits from investments before allowing adopting SMS. This study uses a combination of exploratory and empirical research design to identify and validate the performance measures relevant to the evaluation of SMS investments in auto-component manufacturing SMMEs based in India. The study found that an Industry 4.0 enabled SMS offer more competitive benefits compared to a traditional manufacturing system. The planned investments in SMS can be evaluated on ten performance dimensions namely, cost, quality, flexibility, time, integration, optimized productivity, real-time diagnosis & prognosis, computing, social and ecological sustainability.

The actual PDSI device, as well as the six kinds of SMEs, were then processed. Based on the tested relative permeability of SMEs, FEM models were built and calibrated through the actual PDSI structures. Furthermore, FEM models of single-layer, double-layer, and multilayer inductors were established respectively, with analysis of the differences in magnetic properties. The results reveal that both L and Q of the PDSI exhibit a positive linear correlation with the relative permeability of the SMEs, and SMEs with high permeability limit the magnetic leakage. The multilayer inductor could achieve similar L and Q values with a smaller area compared with the planar inductor. However, the increase in thickness limits their application in thin devices. The models can be adjusted to match the SME properties and size parameters of the actual manufacturing process, contributing to simplified calculations for inductor design and performance analysis.

Based on a literature review, there have been almost no direct relationships between the I4-Food-Agriculture (I4FA) Nexus and the agroecosystem. This study aimed to evaluate the state-of-the-art relationships between the I4FA Nexus and the agroecosystem and to discuss the challenges in the sustainable FAI that can be assisted by the I4 technologies. This objective was fulfilled by (a) reviewing all the relevant publications and (b) drawing a conceptual relationship between the I4FA Nexus and the agroecosystem, in which the I4FA Nexus is categorized into socio-economic and environmental (SEE) perspectives. Four points are highlighted in the present review. First, I4 technology is projected to grow in the agricultural and food sectors today and in the future. Second, food agriculture output may benefit from I4 by considering the SEE benefits. Third, implementing I4 is a challenging journey for the sustainable FAI, especially for the small to medium enterprises (SMEs). Fourth, environmental, social, and governance (ESG) principles can help to manage I4's implementation in agriculture and food. The advantages of I4 deployment include (a) social benefits like increased occupational safety, workers' health, and food quality, security, and safety; (b) economic benefits, like using sensors to reduce agricultural food production costs, and the food supply chain; and (c) environmental benefits like reducing chemical leaching and fertilizer use. However, more studies are needed to address social adaptability, trust, privacy, and economic income uncertainty, especially in SMEs or in businesses or nations with lower resources; this will require time for adaptation to make the transition away from human ecology.

Typically this disproportionately affects Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs), for which credit may be restricted or too costly, due to the difficulty of predicting the Probability of Default (PD). However, if data from other related credit risk domains is available Transfer Learning may be applied to successfully train models, e.g., from the credit card lending and debt consolidation (CD) domains to predict in the small business lending domain. In this article, we report successful results from an approach using transfer learning to predict the probability of default based on the novel concept of Progressive Shift Contribution (PSC) from source to target domain. Toward real-world application by lenders of this approach, we further address two key questions. The first is to explain transfer learning models, and the second is to adjust features when the source and target domains differ. To address the first question, we apply Shapley values to investigate how and why transfer learning improves model accuracy, and also propose and test a domain adaptation approach to address the second. These results show that adaptation improves model accuracy in addition to the improvement from transfer learning. We extend this by proposing and testing a combined strategy of feature selection and adaptation to convert values of source domain features to better approximate values of target domain features. Our approach includes a strategy to choose features for adaptation and an algorithm to adapt the values of these features. In this setting, transfer learning appears to improve model accuracy by increasing the contribution of less predictive features.

In current literature a litany of XAI methods are available that provide a variety of insights into the learning and function of AI models. XAI methods provide a human readable output for the AI's learned processes. These XAI methods provide very subjective outputs with varying degrees of quality. Currently, there are no metrics or methods of objectively evaluating XAI generated explanations against outputs from other XAI methods or to test repeatable consistency of explanations from a single XAI method. This research presents two constituent elements, similarity and stability, to explore the concept of explainability for time series medical data (ECG).

Current research suggests that the emergence of AI promises significant advantages to organisations, particularly for FEP. The purpose of this paper was to explore the readiness of organisations to use AI in the FEP phase to enhance project outcomes. The technology-organisation-environment (TOE) framework was used to evaluate factors influencing the readiness to adopt AI in construction projects in Saudi Arabia. Thirty interviews were conducted with public and private stakeholders in the sector. The knowledge and insight gained from the viewpoints of key decision makers and practitioners allowed for an examination of the main factors impacting the adoption of AI, and any challenges and barriers to it. Findings showed that the support of the government and senior management, and the attitudes and behaviour of employees, were the top three factors in the framework that facilitate the readiness of organisations to adopt AI. Government support influences external support and enhances competitive pressure between organisations; senior management support influences the absorptive capacity and maturity of an organisation; and employees' attitudes and behaviours are the main contributors to organisational readiness. The proposed framework will assist policymakers in using these factors to overcome the challenges of AI adoption.

In doing so, this paper proposes a credit risk feature selection approach that integrates the binary opposite whale optimization algorithm (BOWOA) and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) statistic. Furthermore, we use seven machine learning classifiers and three discriminant methods to verify the robustness of the proposed model by using three actual bank data from SMEs.

With ChatGPT and other large generative models taking the technology to the next level, solutions are urgently needed. In a much-anticipated move, the European Commis-sion advanced two proposals outlining the European approach to AI liability in September 2022: a novel AI Liability Directive (AILD) and a revision of the Product Liability Directive (PLD). They constitute the final cornerstone of AI regulation in the EU. Crucially, the liability proposals and the proposed EU AI Act are inherently intertwined: the latter does not con-tain any individual rights of affected persons, and the former lack specific, substantive rules on AI development and deployment. Taken together, these acts may well trigger a ""Brussels effect"" in AI regulation, with significant consequences for the US and other countries.Against this background, this paper makes three novel contributions. First, it examines in detail the liability proposals and shows that, while making steps in the right direction, they ultimately represent a half-hearted approach: if enacted as foreseen, AI liability in the EU will primarily rest on disclosure of evidence mechanisms and a set of narrowly defined presumptions concerning fault, defectiveness and causality.Hence, second, the article suggests amendments to the proposed AI liability framework. They are collected in a concise Annex at the end of the paper. I argue, inter alia, that the dichotomy between the fault-based AILD Proposal and the supposedly strict liability PLD Proposal is fictional and should be abandoned; that an EU framework for AI liability should comprise one fully harmonizing regulation instead of two insufficiently coordinated direc-tives; and that the current proposals unjustifiably collapse fundamental distinctions be-tween social and individual risk by equating high-risk AI systems in the AI Act with those under the liability framework.Third, based on an analysis of the key risks AI poses, the final part of the paper maps out a road for the future of AI liability and regulation, in the EU and beyond. More specif-ically, I make four key proposals. Effective compensation should be ensured by combin-ing truly strict liability for certain high-risk AI systems with general presumptions of de-fectiveness, fault and causality in cases involving SMEs or non-high-risk AI systems. The paper introduces a novel distinction between illegitimate-and legitimate-harm models to delineate strict liability's scope. Truly strict liability should be reserved for high-risk AI sys-tems that, from a social perspective, should not cause harm (illegitimate-harm models, e.g., autonomous vehicles or medical AI). Models meant to cause some unavoidable harm by ranking and rejecting individuals (legitimate-harm models, e.g., credit scoring or insurance scoring) may merely face rebuttable presumptions of defectiveness and causality. General-purpose AI systems and Foundation Models should only be subjected to high-risk regulation, including liability for high-risk AI systems, in specific high-risk use cases for which they are deployed. Consumers, in turn, ought to be liable based on regular fault, in general.Furthermore, innovation and legal certainty should be fostered through a comprehen-sive regime of safe harbours, defined quantitatively to the best extent possible. Moreover, trustworthy AI remains an important goal for AI regulation.        Hence, the liability framework must specifically extend to non-discrimination cases and provide for clear rules concerning explainability (XAI).Finally, awareness for the climate effects of AI, and digital technology more broadly, is rapidly growing in computer science. In diametrical opposition to this shift in discourse and understanding, however, EU legislators have long neglected environmental sustainabil-ity in both the draft AI Act and the proposed liability regime. To counter this, I propose to jump-start sustainable AI regulation via sustainability impact assessments in the AI Act and sustainable design defects in the liability regime. In this way, the law may help spur not only fair AI and XAI, but also sustainable AI (SAI).(c) 2023 Philipp Hacker. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The Analysis and Mapping of Policies for Emerging Infectious Diseases project systematically collects and assesses health-related policies from all United Nations Member States. The recent proliferation of generative artificial intelligence (GAI) tools powered by large language models have led to suggestions that such technologies be incorporated into our project and similar research efforts to decrease the human resources required. To test the accuracy and precision of GAI in identifying and interpreting health policies, we designed a study to systematically assess the responses produced by a GAI tool versus those produced by a SME. We used two validated policy datasets, on emergency and childhood vaccination policy and quarantine and isolation policy in each United Nations Member State. We found that the SME and GAI tool were concordant 78.09% and 67.01% of the time respectively. It also significantly hastened the data collection processes. However, our analysis of non-concordant results revealed systematic inaccuracies and imprecision across different World Health Organization regions. Regarding vaccination, over 50% of countries in the African, Southeast Asian, and Eastern Mediterranean regions were inaccurately represented in GAI responses. This trend was similar for quarantine and isolation, with the African and Eastern Mediterranean regions least concordant. Furthermore, GAI responses only provided laws or information missed by the SME 2.14% and 2.48% of the time for the vaccination dataset and for the quarantine and isolation dataset, respectively. Notably, the GAI was least concordant with the SME when tasked with policy interpretation.

A high-volume automotive paint line typically consists of miles of conveyor lines and dozens of sealing and painting robots equipped with hundreds of sensors and PLCs. It takes a body-in-white several hours to travel on conveyor tracks to complete the painting process. Throughout this process, thousands of process variables are monitored and collected from sensors and devices that control the automatic equipment. When a vehicle is painted, process variables and associated outcomes are collected in a centralized database called the Painted Surface Performance Management (PSPM) system. This database contains a complete history of each painted vehicle and its corresponding quality inspection results. In this work, machine learning (ML) models are used to select a list of the most important features that may affect the outcomes of the painted vehicles. However, this list needs to go through additional steps of feature investigations to validate true causal relationships between the selected features and the target variables. Once this step is completed, the selected features can then be used to target operational first time quality (FTQ) of products through use of such ML models to predict FTQ outcomes. An automotive paint shop data from 2020 to early 2021 was used to conduct a case study to demonstrate the process of feature investigation.

Although the development of new technologies and the establishment of active R & D and commercialization strategies are essential factors in a company's management sustainability, the activation of the technology market in practice is still in progress for its golden age. In this study, to promote a technology transfer-based company's growth and to run technology-based various financial support activities, we develop and propose a new intelligent, deep learning-based technology valuation system that enables technology holders to estimate the economic values of their innovative technologies and further to establish a firm's commercialization strategy.

Therefore, it explores how knowledge, collaboration and learning cultures (including ""acceptance of mistakes"") might help organizations overcome their resistance to change. Design/methodology/approach The study used two sample groups: students aged 18-24 years (330 cases) and employees aged >24 years (326 cases), who worked in knowledge-driven organizations. Structural equation models were developed, assessed and compared. Findings The effect of the ""learning climate"" on ""adaptability to change"" mediated by ""acceptance of mistakes"" has been detected for young students aged 18-24 years; however, this relationship is not significant for business employees aged >24 years. This result indicates that organizations, unlike universities, do not use mistakes as a tool to support learning that is to lead to change. Research limitations/implications Both samples used in the study were obtained from Poland. The business sample was in the majority represented by small and medium-sized enterprises. Therefore, the presented findings may only be applicable to Poland. Practical implications Acceptance of mistakes is vital for developing a learning culture. Mistakes help employees adapt to change. Hence, a learning culture that excludes the acceptance of mistakes is somehow artificial and may be unproductive. Paradoxically, the findings reveal that the fact that employees' intelligence (adaptability to change) improves via mistakes does not mean that organizational intelligence will also increase. Thus, organizations that do not develop mechanisms of learning from mistakes lose the learning potential of their employees. Originality/value This study proposes a constant learning culture scale that includes the ""acceptance of mistakes"" and ""learning climate"" dimensions. Further, it empirically proves the value of mistakes for adaptability to change. Moreover, it also contributes to the existing literature by demonstrating the mechanism of the relationship between knowledge, collaboration and learning cultures in the context of adaptability to change.

As the knowledge economy in Ireland is well established, experts do not expect mass displacement to occur but differ with respect to the predicted rate of change. Novel HR interventions such as hiring for potential, pooling talent and establishing postgraduate supply contracts are seen as key. Current state interventions were mostly viewed positively but revamping of curricula is needed as well as stronger partnerships with tertiary institutions.Research limitations/implicationsThe interpretivist nature of the study limits the generalisability of the findings as they are based on a relatively small sample from one country.

Besides giant AI companies, numerous small and medium-sized enterprises, institutes, and universities (EIUs) have focused on the research and development (R&D) of DL. Considering the high cost of datacenters and high performance computing (HPC) systems, EIUs prefer adopting off-the-shelf GPU clusters as a DL R&D platform for multiple users and developers to process diverse DL workloads. In such scenarios, the scheduling of multiple DL tasks on a shared GPU cluster is both significant and challenging in terms of efficiently utilizing limited resources. Existing schedulers cannot predict the resource requirements of diverse DL workloads, leading to the under-utilization of computing resources and a decline in user satisfaction. This paper proposes GENIE, a QoS-aware dynamic scheduling framework for a shared GPU cluster, which achieves users' QoS guarantee and high system utilization. In accordance with an exhaustive characterization, GENIE analyzes the key factors that affect the performance of DL tasks and proposes a prediction model derived from lightweight profiling to estimate the processing rate and response latency for diverse DL workloads. Based on the prediction models, we propose a QoS-aware scheduling algorithm to identify the best placements for DL tasks and schedule them on the shared cluster.

There is a general consensus amongst researchers and corporates that artificial intelligence (AI) can help in better and faster decision-making. However, many medium, small and micro enterprises (MSMEs) have not adopted AI in the context of automation.Design/methodology/approachThe authors have assigned weights to the barriers of AI implementation by using Best Worst Method (BWM). In this study, the authors argue that the more alternatives there are, the greater the chances of making an error in judgment. This is a drawback of the traditional comparison matrices that are used for assigning weights to attributes/alternatives/factors. Subsequently, we have computed the influence of the barriers on each other using the DEMATEL method. This helped us understand what the drivers of the bottlenecks are and the interlinkages between them.FindingsThe barriers identified are top management support, change resistance from employees, lack of knowledge about AI in automation, Lack of resources to implement the solution, uncertainty regarding the future of benefits, perception of job loss and subsequent conflicts and lack of perseverance. Price of automation, uncertainty regarding future and top management support were identified as factors that drive other bottlenecks.Practical implicationsThe study has theoretical implications, as it corroborates the technology organization environment (TOE) framework in the context of AI automation in MSMEs. This is the first study of this type, to the best of the authors' knowledge, on MSMEs in India. Factors such as lack of top management support, change resistance, perseverance and price of the automation can be viewed as organizational blocks to AI implementation. Lack of knowledge about AI in automation and Lack of resources are technology-related barriers, whereas uncertainty regarding the future of technology and job loss are related to the environment. This has implications for the top management of MSMEs. The results did show that some bottlenecks act as drivers of other bottlenecks. Thus, the MSMEs, which inherently have limited resources, can prioritize their focus on the ones that have high driving power.Originality/valueThe authors have used the TOE framework to refer to the technological, organizational and environmental factors that affect the decisions to adopt a new technology. The decision of the business and government, to participate in the diffusion of AI, may be contingent upon monitoring the bottlenecks and designing mechanisms to enhance use of AI for automation by MSMEs across India.

The primary task of developing such a human-centered system is to accurately understand human behavior. In this paper, we propose a fog computing framework for assembly operation recognition, which brings computing power close to the data source in order to achieve real-time recognition. For data collection, the operator's activity is captured using visual cameras from different perspectives. For operation recognition, instead of directly building and training a deep learning model from scratch, which needs a huge amount of data, transfer learning is applied to transfer the learning abilities to our application. A worker assembly operation dataset is established, which at present contains 10 sequential operations in an assembly task of installing a desktop CNC machine. The developed transfer learning model is evaluated on this dataset and achieves a recognition accuracy of 95% in the testing experiments. (c) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

I apply this framework to the context of the digital revolution and focus on the impact of big data on firms' digitalization priorities. By leveraging a large-scale survey of more than twenty thousand Italian firms of all sizes, I find that big data improves the digitalization awareness of firms only if they gather big data from more than one source (otherwise, counterintuitively, it may even decrease it). I also find a positive effect of source variety both on the likelihood of prioritizing individual digitalization factors and on the variety of digitalization factors prioritized.

Effective planning, within the management of the production system, has a key role in achieving business success and achieving a competitive advantage for any company. The main setting of the research is the integration of three phases into one intelligent system. The first phase of the research consists of big data optimization of the planning model in the parallel connection of machines, the second phase of the experiment includes the application of different machine learning models, while the third represents the optimization of the planning model in the parallel connection of machines with stochastic processing times, which represents one of the more difficult NP problems of combinatorial optimization. The integration of machine learning models and job planning models in parallel machine connection under conditions of uncertainty is a big challenge. One of the reasons for the application of machine learning models is the influence of the input optimization parameters on the observed objective function. By choosing optimal optimization parameters, it is possible to solve the problem of parallel machine planning with stochastic processing times.

Assessing the financial health of business entities using various models is an important area in not only scientific research, but also business practice.Purpose of the article: This study aims to predict the bankruptcy of companies in the engineer-ing and automotive industries of the Slovak Republic using a multilayer neural network and logistic regression. Importantly, we develop a novel an early warning model for the Slovak engi-neering and automotive industries, which can be applied in countries with undeveloped capital markets.Methods: Data on the financial ratios of 2,384 companies were used. We used a logistic regres-sion to analyse the data for the year 2019 and designed a logistic model. Meanwhile, the data for the years 2018 and 2019 were analysed using the neural network. In the prediction model, we analysed the predictive performance of several combinations of factors based on the industry sector, use of the scaling technique, activation function, and ratio of the sample distribution to the test and training parts.Findings & value added: The financial indicators ROS, QR, NWC/A, and PC/S reduce the likelihood of bankruptcy. Regarding the value of this work, we constructed an optimal network for the automotive and engineering industries using nine financial indicators on the input layer in combination with one hidden layer. Moreover, we developed a novel prediction model for bank-ruptcy using six of these indicators. Almost all sampled industries are privatised, and most com-panies are foreign owned.

As a national initiative, AISG brings together the strength of Singaporean research bodies in Singapore's Autonomous Universities (AUs) and research institutes, together with the vibrant ecosystem of AI start-ups and companies developing AI products, to perform use-inspired research, create innovative AI solution, and develop the talent to power Singapore's AI efforts.        To achieve Singapore's national mission, AISG's activities are anchored around four key pillars:        AI research is geared toward building deep AI research capabilities in Singapore through fundamental research. This pillar invests in research for next-generation AI techniques/algorithms beyond deep learning, and aims to strengthen Singapore's scientific leadership as a key player in the global AI race.        AI technology is focused on creating significant economic and social impacts by tackling national or global challenges using AI. Under this pillar, the first AI in Health Grand Challenge was launched in June 2018, where the challenge statement was ""How can AI help primary care teams stop or slow disease progression and complication development in three ""Highs"" (or 3H)Hyperglycaemia (diabetes), Hyperlipidaemia (high cholesterol), and Hypertension (high blood pressure)patients by 20% in five years?"" This AI challenge is a novel approach to multidisciplinary collaboration and translation from research to practice. It has enabled local and international collaborators to come together to address Singapore's national health challenge.        AI industry innovation accelerates the adoption of AI technology in the industry through proof-of-concept projects and talent development. Under the 100Experiments program, AISG has undertaken 50 AI projects for our local industry and has deployed more than 10 projects into production.a Our award-winning AI Apprenticeship Programme (AIAP),b which is a full-time, nine-month program to train and groom local Singaporean AI talent, has seen about 60 engineers graduate from the program as of October 2019. The plan is to train up to 500 Singaporean AI apprentices over the next five years.        AI Makerspace is a first for Singapore. Leveraging on the intellectual properties (IPs) and experiences from the other three pillars, AI Makerspace hosts an AI knowledge base (that is, open source AI libraries, API, and datasets) and will be the first national platform for accessing cutting-edge AI tools and solutions for research and commerce. Targeted at small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and start-ups, AI Makerspace will help industries jump-start their AI journey by providing access to resources for experimentation, such as curated datasets from industry and government, cutting-edge AI tools, and supercomputing resources specialized for AI workloads.",,10.1145/3378416     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),,,,True,True,False,False

In this context, innovative digital solutions are often adopted and developed, including the Internet of Things (IoT). In order to fully understand the potential, trends, and challenges related to the implementation of these technologies in data management, we seek to identify the most promising architectural choices for an IoT infrastructure from the perspective of key aspects in the context of Data Management. In this way, we aim to provide a comprehensive overview of IoT systems to guide organizations towards more informed decisions, offering cutting-edge solutions and contributing to digital transformation. This work aims to examine aspects such as Data Collection, Data Aggregation, Data Integration, Data Security, Data Retention, and Data Analysis, with particular attention to emerging challenges in these contexts. Within the context of digital innovation, our study focuses on several areas of interest. For example, in the field of smart cities, we explore how the use of Cloud, Fog, and Edge Computing technologies can improve video surveillance and promote the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) for better management of smart cities. Cloud computing, characterized by centralized data processing and storage, represents a well established paradigm of IoT infrastructure. Fog computing extends these capabilities to the network edge, bringing computation and data storage closer to the data source, thereby reducing latency and enhancing real-time processing. Edge computing takes this concept further by processing data directly at or near the data source, minimizing the need for data to traverse long distances to centralized hubs, thus enabling even faster response times and improved efficiency. Additionally, we examine how human-centric methods and user modeling tools can facilitate the transition to intelligent environments, such as workplaces, healthcare, and cities. Considering the emerging challenges in IoT data management, our work provides an overview of the solutions offered by Cloud, Fog, and Edge Computing, enabling industries and small and medium-sized enterprises to adopt targeted and sustainable digital transformation strategies.",,10.1145/3631700.3665238     WE  - Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),ENABLING TECHNOLOGIES;INTERNET;SECURE;THINGS,,,True,True,False,False

It has two modules: transmitter-interpreter system (TIS) and receiver-actuator system (RAS) that performs three hand pose: (i) pulp pinch, (ii) cylindrical grip, and (iii) resting hand. The system uses a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifier with real-time disruptive windowing (80 ms) and a majority vote algorithm (n=3) as post-processing. TIS classifies and transmits a hand pose within 300 ms to RAS, which executes the hand pose.Results: The LDA classifier was trained with ten datasets of surface myoelectric signals (sMES) recorded from a healthy volunteer. The system's accuracy reached 90% in real-time tests with three everyday objects. Splints were 3D-printed with resistant material, so the fitting and range of motion were comfortable for the volunteer.Conclusion: The prototype achieved the recommendations in the literature, and it was the orthosis that most fulfilled said requirements compared to state-of-the-art (2017 to 2020) myoelectric robotic hand orthosis. However, it only assists with finger flexion. Significance: The open-source format provides other researchers a starting point to develop an orthosis for in-home rehabilitation that actively assists in ADLs.

Yet most firms in the world employ fewer than 50 people and can, therefore, rarely rely on big data for automation. In our study, we ask auditors, who mainly audit SMEs, about their expectations towards the impact of AI on the auditing profession and where they expect it to provide the most value when it comes to auditing SMEs. We find that these auditors expect significant improvements in their own efficiency on the job, that learning to use AI applications will not be a challenge for them, and that the use of AI in auditing firms will become mandatory in the future. They expect the performance of certain tasks to become AI-augmented, including risk assessment of individual transactions, conducting audit interviews, performing all manners of analysis, writing confirmation letters, performing the final verification of annual reports, and performing physical observations.

It is necessary to consider what features and standards online shops will have to meet in order to achieve success and to adapt to the changing preferences and requirements of the customer and their awareness of the perception of the environment through the prism of, for example, sustainable development. This means there is a need to specify a set of attributes that will influence the decision to use the services of a given e-shop. Despite all efforts, many online shops fail because they do not meet the expectations of customers. At the same time, meeting customer expectations is a big challenge for newly emerging e-shops. There are many studies on sustainable development in e-commerce, but there is no specific methodology for e-shop design, especially in the aspect of sustainable development. The authors propose a methodology based on Kano's model and customer satisfaction to explore customers' stated needs and unstated desires and to divided them into different groups with different impacts on customer satisfaction. In this paper, a case study on the attributes of customer satisfaction for a newly opened e-shop with organic products, which is to operate in the countries of Central Europe and takes into account selected assumptions of sustainable development, was presented. The research took the form of an original (authorial), universal survey that can be used in other similar research.

However, there appears to be a somewhat limited adoption of ML by farm businesses, highlighted by a review of the literature investigating innovative behaviors by rural businesses. A review of the literature identified a dearth of studies investigating ML adoption by farm businesses in rural regions of the United Arab Emirates (UAE), especially in the context of family-owned farms. Therefore, this paper aims to investigate the drivers and barriers to ML adoption by family/non-family-owned farms in rural UAE. The key research questions are (1) what are the drivers and barriers for rural UAE farms adopting ML? As well as (2) is there a difference in the drivers and barriers between family and non-family-owned farms? Twenty semi-structured interviews were conducted with farm businesses across several rural regions in the UAE. Then, through a Template Analysis (TA), drivers and barriers for rural UAE-based farm owners adopting ML were identified. Interview findings highlighted that farms could benefit from adopting ML in daily operations to save costs and improve efficiency. However, 16 of 20 farms were unaware of the benefits related to ML due to access issues (highlighted by 12 farms) in incorporating ML operations, where they felt that incorporating ML into their operations was costly (identified by 8 farms). It was also identified that non-family-owned farms were more likely to take up ML, which was attributed to local culture influencing family farms (11 farms identified culture as a barrier). This study makes a theoretical contribution by proposing the Machine Learning Adoption Framework (MLAF). In terms of practical implications, this study proposes an ML program specifically targeting the needs of farm owners in rural UAE.

When implemented, Industry 4.0 technologies have a huge impact on efficiency, productivity and profitability of businesses. The adoption and implementation of Industry 4.0, however, require to overcome a number of practical challenges, in most cases, due to the lack of modernisation and automation in place with traditional manufacturers. This paper presents a first of its kind case study for moving a traditional food manufacturer, still using the machinery more than one hundred years old, a common occurrence for small- and medium-sized businesses, to adopt the Industry 4.0 technologies. The paper reports the challenges we have encountered during the transformation process and in the development stage. The paper also presents a smart production control system that we have developed by utilising AI, machine learning, Internet of things, big data analytics, cyber-physical systems and cloud computing technologies. The system provides novel data collection, information extraction and intelligent monitoring services, enabling improved efficiency and consistency as well as reduced operational cost. The platform has been developed in real-world settings offered by an Innovate UK-funded project and has been integrated into the company's existing production facilities. In this way, the company has not been required to replace old machinery outright, but rather adapted the existing machinery to an entirely new way of operating.

For a given tool (i.e., geometry or materials), many shop floors still follow a standard rule by pre-setting a tool life, which is conservative but not realistic. Premature failure of atool can cause unexpected machine downtime and material losses, while another tool could serve beyond that pre-set life. As a result, optimized tool life and productivity cannot be achieved. Moreover, nowadays, there is an incread demand of process monitoring and optimization on the unmanned andthe semi-automated shop floors.        Tool condition monitoring (TCM) systems for process improvement and optimization have been in research for several decades. Both offline and online TCM systems are invented and discussed. A wide range of original publications are reported focusing on different sub-topics, e.g., specific machining process-based TCM methods, measurement or signal acquisition methods, processing methods, and classifiers. With the recent evolution of smart sensors in the era of Industry 4.0, development of online TCM systems received much attention to the researchers. Accordingly, research on some sub-topics also gets motivated into different directions, such as, feasibility of power or current sensors, machine vision technique, and combination of multi-sensors. Thus, from the industrial viewpoint, the current state of implementation of the propod TCM systems for (near) real-time process monitoring and control needs to be clear. This paper presents the state-of-the-art of the TCM systems covering three major machining operations, discusses their application feasibility in industry environments, and states some current TCMS implementations. Challenges being faced by the industry are concluded, along with direction and suggestions for future researches. (c) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The volume of individual case safety reports (ICSRs) increases yearly, but it is estimated that more than 90% of AEs go unreported. In this landscape, embracing assistive technologies at scale becomes necessary to obtain a higher yield of AEs, to maintain compliance, and transform the PV professional work life.AimThe aim of this study was to identify areas across the PV value chain that can be augmented by cognitive service solutions using the methodologies of contextual analysis and cognitive load theory. It will also provide a framework of how to validate these PV cognitive services leveraging the acceptable quality limit approach.MethodsThe data used to train the cognitive service were an annotated corpus consisting of 20,000 ICSRS from which we developed a framework to identify and validate 40 cognitive services ranging from information extraction to complex decision making. This framework addresses the following shortcomings: (1) needing subject-matter expertise (SME) to match the artificial intelligence (AI) model predictions to the gold standard, commonly referred to as ground truth' in the AI space, (2) ground truth inconsistencies, (3) automated validation of prediction missing context, and (4) auto-labeling causing inaccurate test accuracy. The method consists of (1) conducting contextual analysis, (2) assessing human cognitiveworkload,(3) determining decision points for applying artificial intelligence (AI), (4) defining the scope of the data, or annotated corpus required for training and validation of the cognitive services, (5) identifying and standardizing PV knowledge elements, (6) developing cognitive services, and (7) reviewing and validating cognitive services.ResultsBy applying the framework, we (1) identified 51 decision points as candidates for AI use, (2) standardized the process to make PV knowledge explicit, (3) embedded SMEs in the process to preserve PV knowledge and context, (4) standardized acceptability by using established quality inspection principles, and (5) validated a total of 126 cognitive services.ConclusionThe value of using AI methodologies in PV is compelling; however, as PV is highly regulated, acceptability will require assurances of quality, consistency, and standardization.

Findings: Using HCDe-MLS, H2AI was developed and facilitated labeling of 139 videos (mean = 29.83 min) with 3189 images labeled (mean = 75 s) by 6 nurses. OpenCV was used for video -to -image pre-processing; and MobileFaceNet was used for default landmark placement on images. H2AI randomly assigned videos to nurses for data labeling, tracked labelers' inter-rater reliability, and stored labeled data to train ML models.

In the present case, flat bread extrusion was used as an example food process. Dynamic changes of torque, specific mechanical energy (SME) and pressure were identified (modelled) and control ed using two independently taught feed-forward artificial neural networks (ANN). SME, torque and pressure are system parameters which can be controlled with process parameters, such as feed moisture, mass feed rate and screw speed. Target parameters, such as product expansion index, bulk density, etc. are normally difficult to measure on-line, but can be estimated as functions the system parameters. For the modelling of the whole flat bread extrusion cooking process a MIMO (multi input and multi output) approach was necessary. The neural network topology for the process model was 21-9-3 and for the controller 18-20-2. The process model was taught with 629 real data samples and the controller with 115 synthetic samples created with the process model.

The variety of devices has raised a major problem of managing SmE. An increasingly adopted solution to the problem is the modeling of goals and intentions, and then using artificial intelligence to control the respective SmE accordingly. Generally, the solution advocates that the goals can be achieved by controlling the evolution of the states of the devices. In order to automatically reach a particular state, a sophisticated solution is required through which the respective commands, notifications and their correct sequence can be discovered and enforced on the real devices.        In this paper, a comprehensive methodology is proposed by considering a) the composite nature of the state of an individual device; b) the possible variation of specific commands, notifications and their sequence based on the current states of the devices.        The methodology works at two levels: design-time and runtime. At design-time, it constructs the extended data and control flow behavioral graphs of the devices by using the concepts of a model checking approach. Then, at runtime, it uses these graphs for finding the reliable evolution through which the desired goal can be fulfilled.

Meanwhile, the governments' ability to save the economy depends on how banks provide credit to troubled companies. Therefore, the impact of the epidemic on bank credit and inclusive finance are worth exploring. However, most of the existing studies focus on the reform of the financial and economic system, only paying attention to the theoretical mechanism analysis and effect adjustment, scant data support, and insufficient scheme landing. At the same time, with the rise and rapid development of artificial intelligence technology in recent years, all walks of life have introduced it into real scenes for multi-source heterogeneous big data analysis and decision-making assistance. Therefore, we first take the Chinese mainland as an example in this paper. By studying the impact of the epidemic on bank credit preference and the mechanism of inclusive finance, we can provide objective decision-making basis for the financial system in the post-epidemic era to better flow credit funds into various entities and form a new perspective for related research. Then, we put forward a model based on Bi-directional Long Short-term Memory Network (BiLSTM) and Attention Mechanism to predict the number of newly diagnosed cases during the COVID-19 pandemic every day. It is not only suitable for COVID-19 pandemic data characterized by time series and nonlinearity, but also can adaptively select the most relevant input data by introducing an Attention Mechanism, which can solve the problems of huge calculation and inaccurate prediction results. Finally, through experiments and empirical research, we draw the following conclusions: (1) The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic will promote enterprises to increase credit. (2) Banks provide more credit to large enterprises. (3) The epidemic has different impacts on credit in different regions, with the most significant one on central China. (4) Banks tend to provide more credit to manufacturing industries under the epidemic. (5) Digital inclusive finance plays a (positive) regulating effect on bank credit in COVID-19 pandemic. Inspired by the research results, policymakers can consider further solving the information asymmetry and strengthening the construction of a credit system, and more direct financial support policies for enterprises should be adopted.

From a practical standpoint, the idea of utilizing a subject matter expert SME) as a basis for judgment on a design's manufacturability early in the design process lacks feasibility due to the inability to efficiently and effectively evaluate a large tradespace of unique design alternatives. The practice of Design for Manufacturing (DFM) analysis typically involves having access to design geometry and specifications with some consideration of the manufacturing processes. However, in the conceptual stage, the challenge involves assessing manufacturability based on a significant number of unknown parameters and doing so in a manner which is nonsubjective. Furthermore, evaluation of early stage product designs has significant influence on program cost. So, how can programs realize the impact of design options that may influence manufacturability and relate this back to a common frame of reference (i.e., cost, schedule, risk)? A research challenge includes determining how to harness the knowledge that is used to determine manufacturability from both factual and heuristic-based approaches, which requires some knowledge of the design parameters and the decision-making involved with assessing manufacturability. There are different ways to explore this area of research, but one possible approach rests in the exploration of artificial intelligence and how it can be applied in the area of manufacturability assessments. There are various subsets of artificial intelligence; some involve areas such as rule-based engines and systems, knowledge graphs, and expert systems, while others explore more complex areas such as machine learning and neural networks. The choice on which path to take requires some exploration into these possibilities and an understanding of the design data available in premilestone A and how feature-based information can be used to create an objective-based manufacturability assessment. This paper serves to explore the options for incorporating artificial intelligence within the MAKE assessment methodology and related software tool.

Currently, it is accomplished via manual forensic reviews by subject matter experts (SMEs). However, with the increase in the amount of data produced in airspace operations, relying on such manual reviews is impractical. Automated approaches, such as exceedance detection, have been deployed to flag safety events which surpass a pre-defined safety threshold. These approaches, however, completely rely on domain knowledge and outcome of the SMEs' reviews and can only identify purely threshold crossings safety vulnerabilities. Unsupervised and supervised machine learning approaches have been developed in the past to automate the process of anomaly detection and vulnerability discovery in the aviation data, with availability of the labeled data being their differentiator. Purely unsupervised approaches can be prone to high false alarm rates, while a completely supervised approach might not reach optimal performance and generalize well when the size of labeled data is small. This is one of the fundamental challenges in the aviation domain, where the process of obtaining safety labels for the data requires significant time and effort from SMEs and cannot be crowd-sourced to citizen scientists. As a result, the size of properly labeled and reviewed data is often very small in aviation safety and supervised approaches fall short of the optimum performance with such data. In this paper, we develop a Robust and Explainable Semi-supervised deep learning model for Anomaly Detection (RESAD) in aviation data. This approach takes advantage of both majority unlabeled and minority labeled data sets. We develop a case study of multi-class anomaly detection in the approach to landing of commercial aircraft in order to benchmark RESAD's performance to baseline methods. Furthermore, we develop an optimization scheme where the model is optimized to not only reach maximum accuracy, but also a desired interpretability and robustness to adversarial perturbations.",,10.3390/aerospace9080437     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),anomaly detection;semi-supervised learning;explainable AI;aviation safety,,,True,False,True,False

For achieving realistic responses, real wind speed data extracted from Zaafarana wind farm, Egypt, are considered in the analyses. The effectiveness of the ANFIS-GA controller is compared with that obtained using optimised proportional-integral controllers by the novel grey wolf optimiser algorithm taking into consideration severe grid disturbances. The validity of the ANFIS-GA control scheme is verified by the extensive simulation analyses, which are performed using MATLAB/Simulink environment.

The technology acceptance model (TAM) formed the basis of the model development, which was extended in the study to include an analysis of how knowledge sharing (KOS), perceived value (PEV), perceived privacy awareness and control (PRI) and perceived security (SEC) influenced the primary TAM components of perceived ease of use (PEU), perceived usefulness (PRU) and intention to use m-wallets among Palestinian users.Design/methodology/approachThis study used questionnaires as its primary data collection method. The questionnaires were distributed via online media, and the data collection period spanned from January 10, 2023, to February 21, 2023. The study received 360 responses from participants. Smart PLS and SPSS v.23 software were used to perform a method test on the collected questionnaire data.FindingsThe study's findings demonstrate the factors influencing Palestinian users' adoption of m-wallets by extending the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) to include knowledge sharing, perceived value, privacy awareness and control and security, in addition to the main TAM elements, perceived ease of use (PEU) and perceived usefulness (PU), offering new insights into technology adoption in developing regions and addressing gaps in the literature.Research limitations/implicationsThis study has some limitations. First, it is limited because it looks at users' intentions to use rather than their actual usage. The actual use of an m-wallet should be the topic of further research. Second, rather than focusing on Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), this study examined users' intentions to use m-wallets. Thus, SMEs' use of m-wallets may be studied in future research. Third, because the study users were from Palestine, the results may not be generalizable. Therefore, additional populations and cultures should be studied in future research. Fourth, the study used a convenience sample of 282 users. As a result, it is not easy to generalize to a sizable population. Future studies should use larger sample sizes or random samples. Finally, this study examined the direct relationship between independent and dependent variables. Future research may consider personal innovativeness and artificial intelligence as potential moderators.Practical implicationsUser knowledge sharing can be an important factor driving user intention to use m-wallet. Users can raise awareness of m-wallets by sharing their knowledge and experiences with others about their uses, features and advantages. This is particularly useful in a country like Palestine, where m-wallets are not widely accepted or used. Therefore, m-wallets service providers should improve their services to motivate the users to share their knowledge with others to increase user intention to use. For instance, m-wallet service providers can provide user support programs that assist users in resolving issues, responding to inquiries and offering feedback on the service. Additionally, m-wallet service providers can enhance the user experience of their m-wallet by providing user-friendly interfaces, quick and dependable service and robust security features. By improving the user experience and providing users with a supportive and responsive environment, service providers can encourage users to share their positive experiences with others and increase user intention to use the m-wallet. User knowledge sharing can be an important factor driving user intention to use m-wallet.        Users can raise awareness of m-wallets by sharing their knowledge and experiences with others about their uses, features and advantages. This is particularly useful in a country like Palestine, where m-wallets are not widely accepted or used. Therefore, m-wallets service providers should improve their services to motivate the users to share their knowledge with others to increase user intention to use. For instance, m-wallet service providers can provide user support programs that assist users in resolving issues, responding to inquiries and offering feedback on the service. Additionally, m-wallet service providers can enhance the user experience of their m-wallet by providing user-friendly interfaces, quick and dependable service and robust security features.Social implicationsThe widespread adoption of m-wallets is an important area of research, as it has significant theoretical implications for technology adoption. M-wallets provide an easy and secure way to pay without cash or physical cards. Therefore, identifying the factors affecting users' intention to use m-wallets can help Palestinian m-wallet service providers to develop their marketing strategies. Extending the TAM to include four important factors (knowledge sharing, perceived value, perceived privacy awareness and control and perceived security) has improved our understanding of technology adoption models. The study empirically examines the intentions of Palestinian users to use m-wallets and how this novel technology is used in this area of the Arab world. The results empirically support that these factors strongly affect users' intentions to use m-wallets. Thus, this study fills the knowledge gap about the factors influencing the use of m-wallets in Palestine and adds to the literature on the user intentions to use new technologies. Finally, this study is one of the first to examine the relationship between knowledge sharing, perceived value, perceived privacy awareness and control, perceived security and technology acceptance models in general and the extended TAM with these factors in a specific m-wallet context.Originality/valueThe preliminary empirical study investigates the factors affecting the use of m-wallets in Palestine by extending TAM with knowledge sharing, perceived value, perceived privacy awareness and control and perceived security as external variables to the model. The findings of this study help to fill a gap in the existing literature by identifying key variables that affect Palestinians' intentions to use m-wallet. This study also contributes to the increase in knowledge in the area. To date, no studies have explored privacy in terms of awareness, control and knowledge sharing as essential factors that affect users' intention to use m-wallets in Palestine.",,10.1108/VJIKMS-03-2023-0055,Mobile wallet;Knowledge sharing;Perceived value;Perceived privacy awareness and control;Perceived security;Perceived ease of use;Perceived usefulness;Palestine;TECHNOLOGY ACCEPTANCE;BEHAVIORAL INTENTION;INFORMATION-TECHNOLOGY;CONTINUANCE INTENTION;SOCIAL-INFLUENCE;PAYMENT;CONSUMERS;INTERNET;MODEL;TRUST,,,True,False,False,False

Researchers have already started automating various activities of the SME workflow. Understanding the requirements for maintenance and development work i.e. Requirements Engineering (RE) is a crucial phase that kicks off the SME workflow through multiple discussions on a proposed scope of work documented in different forms. The RE phase ends with a list of user stories for each unit task and usually created and tracked on a project management tool such as GitHub, Jira, AzurDev, etc. In this research, we collaborated with Bell Mobility to develop a tool ""Geneus"" (Generate UserSory) using GPT-4-turbo to automatically create user stories from software requirements documents. Requirements documents are usually long and contain complex information. Since LLMs typically suffer from hallucination when the input is too complex, this paper proposes a new prompting strategy, ""Refine and Thought"" (RaT), to mitigate that issue and improve the performance of the LLM in prompts with large and noisy contexts. Along with manual evaluation using RUST (Readability, Understandability, Specificity, Technical-aspects) survey questionnaire, automatic evaluation with BERTScore, and AlignScore evaluation metrics are used to evaluate the results of the ""Geneus"" tool. Results show that our method with RaT performs consistently better in most of the cases of interactions compared to the single-shot baseline method. However, the BERTScore and AlignScore test results are not consistent. In the median case, Geneus performs significantly better in all three interactions (requirements specification, user story details, and test case specifications) according to AlignScorebut it shows slightly low performance in requirements specifications according to BERTScore. Distilling RE documents requires significant time & effort from the senior members of the team through multiple meetings with stakeholders. We believe automating this process will certainly reduce additional loads off the software engineers and increase the ultimate productivity allowing them to utilize their time on other prioritized tasks.",,10.1109/ICSME58944.2024.00082     WE  - Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),LLM;Prompt Engineering;Refine and Thought;User Story;Auto Generate;Software Maintenance Tasks,,,True,False,True,False

Real-time Artificial Intelligence (AI) based monitoring systems are on the rise as an alternative to post-processing inspection techniques with advances in sensing techniques and Deep Learning (DL). The article focuses on how the manifolds learnt by the embedded space of the two convolutional generative models, such as autoencoder, and Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), could be exploited to differentiate built conditions. The co-axially mounted CCD camera acquired the melt pool morphology corresponding to six build parameters covering the process map from Lack of Fusion (LoF) to conduction regime. The images acquired from the CCD camera constituted the dataset to train and test the model performance. After training, the latent space of both the networks would have captured the commonality and differences, i. e. unique manifolds of the melt pool morphologies corresponding to the six build conditions. The learned manifolds from the two trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) models were exploited by combining with One-Class SVM to classify the ideal build quality from the other conditions supervisedly. The prediction of the trained One-class SVM on the two latent spaces of the CNN models had an overall classification accuracy of similar to 97%.

Then, validate the developed DVSM framework model through interviews with subject matter experts (SMEs) and pilot deployment of the DVSM framework model at a selected onshore prefabrication yard. The pilot deployment of the DVSM framework provided the outcome of the analysis of the existing process flow, then an enabler to predict the future state of the onshore prefabrication process flow by eliminating the waste produced from labor and material. Finally, the pilot deployment of the conceptual DVSM framework model has proven that the model has improved the overall onshore prefabrication productivity; the study recommends further expand the DVSM framework model in the offshore environment where to track and improve overall construction productivity during the hookup and commissioning phase either for Brownfield projects or Greenfield projects.",,10.30880/ijie.2024.16.08.014     WE  - Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Artificial intelligent;productivity;construction;prefabrication;VSM;DVSM;IoT;PRODUCTIVITY,,,True,False,False,False

However, the fluctuating and intermittent nature of renewable generation can adversely affect electric grid stability and operations. Conventionally, to overcome these problems, batteries are employed. Nevertheless, the quick charging and discharging cycle reduces the battery life span, resulting in an economic burden and environmental damage. To resolve these problems, short-term Distributed Energy Storage (DES) systems based on advanced technologies, such as Superconducting Magnetic Energy Storage (SMES) and Supercapacitor Energy Storage (SCES), are emerging as potential alternatives. A supplementary regulator which includes storing energy as well as a flexible AC transmission system is designed to boost the minute signal reliability. The precise optimization of multiple energy device characteristics is needed for efficient performance. The artificial intelligence methods and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) are used to obtain the optimum parameters in the micro-hydro system. This research examines the many Energy Storage Systems (ESSs) in power systems, particularly microgrids, and demonstrates their critical role in improving the quality of electrical systems. As a result, the ESSs were divided into several technologies based on the energy storage form and the most important technological features.

Lean manufacturing is one of the main methodologies used by them for increasing their supply chain and logistics performance. Indeed, Logistics performance improvement implies the definition of KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) for measuring at each transformation level, the evolution of the logistics system. Thus, Industry 4.0 and logistics 4.0 concepts are defined for implementing new technologies, tools and organizations in companies in order to define their future. A new framework, based on lean manufacturing and DMAIC methodologies, with sustainability as its kernel has been developed in Icam, A Higher education school, for SMEs. In addition, European population is growing older day by day and they are regularly visiting hospitals. In this context, the treatment of patients in good conditions (quality, cost and lead time) is necessary as much as the hospital global performance. In this frame, a project is ongoing between FEI, a Brazilian University and Icam for defining and implementing Healthcare Logistics 4.0 (including lean manufacturing).        This paper presents concepts, methods and tools of healthcare logistics 4.0 for improving a hospital performance.

To address these challenges, we developed PepExplainer, an explainable graph neural network based on substructure mask explanation (SME). This model excels at deciphering amino acid substructures, translating macrocyclic peptides into detailed molecular graphs at the atomic level, and efficiently handling non-canonical amino acids and complex macrocyclic peptide structures.

Additionally, PepExplainer underwent further validation for bioactivity prediction using an additional set of thirteen newly synthesized macrocyclic peptides. Moreover, it enabled the optimization of the IC50 of a macrocyclic peptide, reducing it from 15 nM to 5.6 nM based on the contribution score provided by PepExplainer.

Enterprises strive to make the most of this scattered, diverse and ever growing data, in order to obtain information they can apply to the decision-making processes. But, apart from the known and researched technical issues of volume, variety and velocity; more essential issues have to be addressed. Namely, how does an enterprise find the analytical model it needs to obtain the information it desires? From simple regression analyses to artificial intelligence, the variety in which data can be analyzed is immense. Involving specialist and consultants is time-consuming, needs effort and is usually too expensive, especially for SMEs.        This paper discusses the current options in the usage of analytics by enterprises as well as the existing challenges and elaborates recommendations for the future. Special focus is put on customer-oriented analytics by means of analytical services. In these, the building blocks of analytics are modularized in three layers: Data Interpretation & Cleansing Layer, Data Processing Layer, and Data Visualization Layer. This modularization allows building analytics in a standardized manner. Such services aim at reducing the gap between the holders of expert knowledge and the users of analytics. This is achieved by placing the attention on obtaining the desired information (choosing from a portfolio of analytics) instead of solving fundamental challenges, already addressed by the respective modules.

Leveraging a novel conceptual framework, we integrate multiple layers of uncertainty-including regulatory, legal, and market-based factors-into an analysis of UK firms' strategic decisions in an open economy. Drawing on firm-level data from Bureau van Dijk's Orbis database and a synthetic control method, we estimate that Brexit uncertainty led to a 9.2% annual reduction in UK services exports, equivalent to a cumulative loss of USD 146.8 billion between 2016 and 2019. Our findings show that Brexit-related uncertainty disproportionately affected small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), while multinational enterprises (MNEs) were more likely to relocate operations outside the UK, exacerbating trade declines. This research highlights the critical role of transparent and predictable regulatory frameworks, risk management policies, and transitional support measures to mitigate the adverse effects of prolonged uncertainty. By identifying the specific mechanisms through which uncertainty shapes export decisions, this study offers key insights for policymakers aiming to foster resilience in the UK's services trade post-Brexit.        In recent years, the United Kingdom's decision to leave the European Union, known as Brexit, has created a cloud of uncertainty over its economic future. This uncertainty has been particularly concerning for the UK's services sector, which is a major part of its economy and includes industries like finance, IT (Information Technology), and transportation. While the impact of Brexit on goods trade has been widely discussed, less attention has been given to how it affects services exports. This study aims to fill that gap by examining the influence of Brexit uncertainty on the UK's international business activities, especially in the services sector.This study uses a multi-level empirical approach (research method based on observation and experience), combining firm-level data from the Orbis database with cross-border investment data. It looks at how Brexit uncertainty has influenced UK firms' decisions to participate in export markets, the intensity of their exports, and whether multinational enterprises (MNEs) have relocated their operations. The research is important because it provides insights into how policy-driven uncertainties, like Brexit, can affect trade and investment decisions in the services sector, which is crucial for the UK economy.The findings reveal that Brexit uncertainty has led to a significant decrease in UK services exports. Firms have been less likely to start exporting, and those already exporting have reduced their export intensity. Moreover, MNEs have been relocating their operations away from the UK, which has further contributed to the decline in services exports. The study estimates that the UK's services exports have been reduced by 9.2% annually since the Brexit referendum, resulting in a substantial economic loss.The research concludes that policy uncertainty, such as that caused by Brexit, can have a profound impact on international business activities. It highlights the need for clear and stable trade policies to support firms in making confident investment and trade decisions. The study's findings suggest that reducing uncertainty can help mitigate the negative effects of economic disengagement, like Brexit, on the services sector. Looking ahead, the research implies that the UK government and businesses must work together to navigate the challenges posed by Brexit and to find new opportunities for growth in the global economy.This text was initially drafted using artificial intelligence, then reviewed by the author(s) to ensure accuracy.

At present grinding appears to be the only practical and economical means of shaping the parts into the final products with fine surface finish, acceptable surface integrity, and high geometric accuracy (Kovach, J. (1987). Improved grinding of ceramic components. In: Proceedings of the Department of Defence, Machine Tool/ Manufacturing Development Conference. AFWAL-TR-4137, Vol. 7, 72-100). In the machining of conventional materials, grinding is also usually used as a finishing operation when high accuracy and surface finish is required, and usually determines the major portion of the processing cost. Despite this importance and popularity, grinding still remains as one of the most difficult to control processes. Unlike machining processes where cutting is performed by a defined single/ multiple cutting edge(s), grinding is performed by a number of abrasive grits, which are randomly oriented within a grinding wheel. Therefore, it is impossible to maintain or control the shape of these hard grits, which are active in the cutting process (Malkin, S. (1989). Grinding Technology, Theory and Applications of Machining with Abrasives, Chister, England: Ellis Horwood Limited; Okafor, A. C., Marcus, M., Tipirneni, R. (1990). Multiple sensor integration via neural networks for estimating surface roughness and bore tolerance in circular end milling. Transaction of NAMRI/SME 128-136). Grinding is a very complicated process, consisting of complex interactions between a large numbers of variables. These variables can be grouped into four major categories: (a) machine tool, (b) workpiece material, (c) grinding wheel, and (d) operating parameters (Allor, R. L. Whalen, T. J., Baer, J. R., Kumar, K. V. (1993). Machining of silicon nitride: experimental determination of process/property relationships.

Modelling of ceramic grinding processes, number of cutting points and grinding forces per grit. Journal of Materials Processing Technology 65(1-3):1-10). The dressing and truing processes used to prepare the wheel have an important effect on the grinding wheel variables and consequently on the output of the grinding process. To achieve this understanding, many researchers focused on the modeling of grinding processes. Some of these models are completely theoretical, and others are practical with theoretical explanations and empirical equations. The aim of this research was to find the relationship between the process variables, the process parameters, and workpiece quality. This review presents the theoretical and experimental models used, process design algorithms, expert systems, artificial intelligent algorithms, fuzzy logic and neural network algorithms, process monitoring and control, and in particular artificial intelligence control systems.",,10.1081/LMST-200028748     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),grinding;intelligent control;neural networks;dressing,,,True,False,True,False

In 2021, the fintech sector reached a record high of 7,321 deals and received a total of 164 billion dollars in investments with 6,000 deals in 2022. The study aims to present Islamic fintech application areas in T & uuml;rkiye in a holistic manner by examining the effects of the fintech sector on Islamic finance and traditional financial markets. It also examines whether Islamic financial institutions have been able to keep pace with the transformation. The study was conducted with qualitative research methods. In the study, data collection methods such as interviews, observation, document analysis, etc., were used to solve the problem. At the same time, the research was evaluated in a realistic manner with an interrogative and interpretive technique. The data were compiled for the purpose of solving the complex situation of the subject, addressing it together and making a final holistic evaluation of the flow of social life. In the age of rapidly developing technology, change and transformation are also evident in the financial system. It is thought that the concept of 'Fintech', which is a combination of the words finance and technology, will have an important place in the financial markets in the future. Fintech, which first manifested themselves in ATMs used for withdrawing and depositing money, then manifested themselves with POS devices or internet and mobile banking technology. In this study, fintech are introduced and their effects on Islamic fintech and traditional financial markets are analyzed. Considering that there is a sufficient amount of studies on fintech in T & uuml;rkiye but few studies on Islamic fintech, it is thought that the study will be original. In the study, a detailed examination of financial technology and Islamic financial technology in T & uuml;rkiye and the world has been made. Financial technology companies operating in the field of fintech operate in a total of 13 areas, including payments, banking, blockchain, corporate finance and insurance. The findings of the study include remote customer acquisition, facilitating banking services through mobile applications and increasing financial literacy, and promoting Islamic banking products through an entrepreneurial web game, most of which have been implemented concretely through Islamic fintech in T & uuml;rkiye. In addition, participation banks, the transformation of mobile phones into POS devices with Mobile POS applications, the 'cash simple' application that allows you to deposit or withdraw money without going to an ATM or branch, the ability to determine the credit score of participation banks' customers with artificial intelligence application without the need for past banking data, the 'kabbage' application that enables participation banks to fully automate loan application processes for SMEs are among the findings of the study as applications in the transformation process of Islamic fintech. In addition, robo-consultancies that provide virtual finance consultancy services that contribute significantly to reducing costs developed using artificial intelligence technology, selim, a digital assistant developed with artificial intelligence technology that constantly improves itself and learns new things, and the garage and guild application that offers incubation centers and acceleration programs launched by Kuveyt T & uuml;rk and Albaraka T & uuml;rk can be counted among the important fintechs.        In addition to these, the venture capital investment funds developed by Kuveyt T & uuml;rk and Albaraka T & uuml;rk, Vak & imath;f Participation and Neova Insurance, the idea platform developed by Kuveyt T & uuml;rk that enables entrepreneurs, university students and all customers to realize their innovative ideas on banking products and services as well as many other different subjects, the digital Turkish Lira step initiated by the Central Bank of the Republic of T & uuml;rkiye, and the mobile applications that offer financial asset trading and analysis launched by Kuveyt T & uuml;rk and Albaraka T & uuml;rk can be counted among the prominent Islamic fintech in the sector. As a result of the evaluations made during the study process, it can be stated that Islamic fintech applications will add dynamism to the Islamic finance market and provide a competitive advantage with their advantages such as low cost, 24/7 accessibility, transparency, reliability, operational convenience and new products. In addition, there are also negative factors such as data security, cybercrimes, money laundering, legal gaps, lack of infrastructure, and non-compliance with the rules of Islamic law, which can be shown among the disadvantages of fintech. It can be said that it would be beneficial for financial institutions to take these factors into consideration in their transformation processes. When Islamic fintech initiatives in T & uuml;rkiye and the response to them are evaluated together, it can be said that Islamic fintech have benefited from the fintech transformation by significantly differentiating from conventional fintech.",,10.52637/kiid.1323142     WE  - Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Islamic Finance;Financial Transformation;Financial Technology;Islamic Fintech,,,True,True,False,False

This survey applies the TOE framework and examines the influence of significant and most commonly known factors on Canadian firms' intention to adopt the said emerging technologies.FindingsStudy results indicate that Canadian accounting professionals' self-assessed knowledge (about these emerging technologies) is more theoretical than operational. Cloud computing is highly used by Canadian firms, while the use of other technologies, particularly blockchain and RPA, is reportedly low. However, firms' intention about the future adoption of these technologies seems positive. Study results reveal that only the relative advantage and top management commitment are found to be significant considerations influencing the adoption intention.Research limitations/implicationsStudy findings confirm some results presented in earlier studies but provide additional insights from a new perspective, that of accounting professionals in Canada. The first limitation relates to the respondents. Although accounting professionals provided valuable insights, their responses are personal views and do not necessarily represent the views of other professionals within the same firm or the official position of their accounting departments or firms. Therefore, the exclusion of diverse viewpoints from the same firm might have negatively impacted the results of this study. Second, this study sample is limited to Canada-based firms, which means that the study reflects only the situation in that country. Third, considering the research method and the limit on the number of questions the authors could ask, respondents were only asked to rate the impact of these five technologies on the accounting field and to clarify which technologies are used.Practical implicationsThis study's findings confirm that the organizational intention to adopt new technology is not primarily based on the characteristics of the technology. In the case of emerging technology adoption, the decision also depends upon other factors related to the internal organization. Furthermore, although this study found no support for the effect of environmental factors, it fills a gap in the literature by including the factor of vendor support, which has received little attention in prior information technology (IT)/ information system (IS) adoption research. Moreover, in contrast to most prior adoption studies, this study elaborates on accounting professionals' experience and perceptions in investigating the organizational adoption and use of emerging technologies. Thus, the findings of this study are valuable, providing insights from a new perspective, that of professional accountants.        Social implicationsThe study findings may serve as a guide for researchers, practitioners, firms and other stakeholders, particularly technology providers, interested in learning about emerging technologies' adoption and use in Canada and/or in a relevant context. Contrary to most prior adoption studies, this study elaborates on accounting professionals' experience and perceptions in investigating the organizational adoption and use of emerging technologies. Thus, the findings of this study are valuable, providing insights from a new perspective, that of professional accountants.Originality/valueThe study provides insights into the said technologies' actual adoption and improves the awareness of firms and stakeholders to the effect of some constructs that influence the adoption of these emerging technologies in accounting.",,10.1108/IJAIM-05-2023-0123,Canada;Accounting;Emerging technology;Technology-organization-environment;Use and adoption;CLOUD COMPUTING ADOPTION;BIG DATA;ARTIFICIAL-INTELLIGENCE;ENTERPRISE SYSTEMS;BLOCKCHAIN;ANALYTICS;SMES;DETERMINANTS;PERSPECTIVE;SERVICES,,,True,False,False,False

According to Skinner's behavioral learning theory (as cited in Gregory, 1987), differences in a student's learning experiences (such as in understanding concepts) lead to considerable disparities in future learning. Drastic differences in internal cognition and concept structure may exist even among students with the same traditional learning achievements (i.e., scores) (Yu & Yu, 2006). Furthermore, the differences in concept cognition structure between experts and novices may be discoverable by analyzing similarities in students' conceptual understandings, relationships, or psychological metrics (Brand-Gruwel et al., 2005; Hsu et al., 2012).        Cognitive diagnostic models, such as the knowledge map, are useful for assessing a student's conceptual knowledge structures and misconceptions to improve differentiated teaching, learning diagnosis, and remedial teaching (Chu et al., 2014; Hwang, Shi et al., 2011; Hwang, Wu et al., 2011; Ku et al., 2014; Lou et al., 2007; Lwo et al., 2013; Ting & Kuo, 2016). However, most such models have been constructed using only vertical hierarchical structures, wherein spotting multilateral correlations or influences between subjects or concepts proves difficult. Unlike an expert, a student cannot intuitively identify the multilateral correlations between the concepts involved a learning pathway, and analyzing novice learning is challenging and requires considerable time and effort.        An adaptive mechanism for diagnosing and analyzing students' dynamic learning behaviors and learning pathways could improve autonomous learning and remedial teaching. However, most existing mechanisms cannot offer adaptive or personalized learning content or pathways to the learner (Singhal, 2012; Ting & Kuo, 2016; Wang et al., 2019).        With the advantages provided by information technologies such as big data analytics and artificial intelligence, large-scale heterogeneous data analysis, cloud computing, and Knowledge Graphs (KGs) with directionally linked data structures have been widely applied in recommendation systems to facilitate the representation of knowledge structures and to mine for new knowledge that helps to meets users' needs (Deng et al., 2019; Fensel et al., 2020; Guan et al., 2019; Jia et al., 2018; Nickel et al., 2016; Noy et al., 2019; Yu et al., 2020). Similar to tree-structured knowledge maps, KGs are based on directional or nondirectional ontological graphs composed of concept nodes and relationship edges and employ the consensus opinions of Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) to generate consolidated KGs or generate KGs automatically from large mined data sets or text. The associated reasoning mechanism is used to make inferences based on the existing concepts and relationships among them. Among all the graph-building options, Petri-Net possess the most robust capabilities for graphical workflow presentation and pathway analysis (Peterson, 1981; Tan & Zhou, 2013). They have long been widely applied in adaptive learning and learning pathway recommendation.        According to information published by the Taiwan Bureau of Foreign Trade and Taiwan Electrical and Electronic Manufacturers' Association in 2020, the electrical and electronics industry accounted for 50.59% of Taiwan's total export value in 2019. The foundational electricity course is an important core course for future electrical and Electronic Engineering (EE) study and can be the first obstacle for novices because of the intricate relationships among its knowledge concepts. Also, significant differences may exist in individual understandings of concept structures (Dai, 2015).        To address the aforementioned challenges in learning diagnostics and remedial teaching, this study was based on learning theories such as the conditions of learning, constructivism, and scaffolding theory and utilized Petri-Net to achieve the following goals:        1. Use a Petri-Net to construct a KG visualizing a foundational electricity course.        2. Conduct a pilot study to identify personal learning pathways, interrelationships among foundational electricity concepts, and misconceptions regarding novices' learning types.        3. Use students' learning history to predict their learning effectiveness when studying future concepts and maximize their learning outcomes.        4. Recommend an adaptive, calibrated, personalized learning pathway for further remedial teaching and learning.        In this study, we employed a three-round modified Delphi technique with 18 SMEs to identify 12 subjects, 58 concepts, and 95 corresponding interrelationships within a core foundational electricity course in EE. We utilized a Petri-Net with graphic features to construct a KG we called a Petri-Net KG.        After the third round of the modified Delphi technique, all eight SMEs' Content Validity Indexes (CVI) were 1.00. Cronbach's a was .75. The SMEs' opinions regarding the interrelationships of concepts exhibited good internal consistency and reliability, according to 95% confidence intervals. The correlations between concept weights were .83-.96 (p<.01). Intraclass Correlation Coefficients (ICCs) were used to confirm the consistency of SMEs' opinions on the weights of the interrelationships between concepts. ICC (1) was.072, and ICC (2) was .75. All the SMEs' opinions exhibited significant and strong correlations and good consistency.        Using 947 students' assessment records, learning portfolios, and learning status data (e.g. conditions of learning performance, scores), the reasoning engine was used to employ the KGs for learning transfer analysis. Preliminary exploration case studies were conducted to create Petri-Net KGs personalized for students with three different learning types (insufficiently hardworking, inadequate learning, and abnormal learning) and to determine their learning progress and status. Sato's student-problem chart was used to classify students' learning types.        The major results and findings of this study are as follows:        1. The most important concept was circuit patterns and characteristics, affecting the learning of the subsequent 12 concepts, and the total impact was 6. Units, vector operations, and voltage-in that order-were the next most important concepts.        2. The proposed Petri-Net KG provided students with visualized learning scaffoldings that indicate the experts' consensus cognitive structure. It also clarified any prior concepts requisite for understanding each concept.        3. By utilizing the weights of the interrelationships between concepts and their prior concepts, the reasoning engine could adaptively diagnose misconceptions and further predict students' effectiveness in learning subsequent concepts.        4. Each learning type was associated with a unique cognitive structure. Integrating students' learning portfolio data into the proposed Petri-Net KG enabled the reasoning engine to recommend an adaptive and personalized learning pathway.        The aforementioned results have the following implications for future applications and research:        1. The visualized Petri-Net KG for the foundational electricity course could clearly depict learning types, experts' consensus knowledge structure, and students' personal cognitive structures. Additionally, most influential concepts were observable at a glance. Such KGs could be useful for guiding concept recognition and effectively diagnosing misconceptions.        2. The personalized learning pathways and content recommended by the Petri-Net KG and reasoning engine can be used in a self-tutoring platform. The weighted concept intercorrelations and student learning data can be analyzed to determine students' cognitive conditions according to an expert KG. Thus, a model or student learning effectiveness can be established to strengthen the effectiveness of autonomous learning or remedial teaching.        The framework of this course-level Petri-Net KG can be extended and applied to other curricula, disciplines, or educational levels to develop appropriate recommendation systems for competency development.",,10.6209/JORIES.202109_66(3).0003     WE  - Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),knowledge graph;Petri-Net;foundational electricity;learning recommendation;learning diagnostic;CONCEPT MAP APPROACH;NOVICE-EXPERT;SCIENCE;LITERACY;REPRESENTATION;INTEGRATION;EDUCATION;SYSTEM;MODEL;TOOL,,,True,False,False,False

It is generally admitted that future competitiveness of European industry and commerce will heavily rely on the success of the efforts to harness and adapt these technologies to meeting the growing demand for lifelong learning. But this is not just an industrial concern, the social and cultural challenges are equally important; peripheral regions, SME's, rural areas, the unemployed, the handicapped are some amongst many other groups which require affordable solutions to their particular needs.        How to realize these potentials? Many different avenues have been explored in the past. For the first time, a European research action was launched to tackle the issue: the DELTA (Developing European Learning through Technological Advance) Exploratory Action brought together a number of projects covering a broad sample of technological options: from applications of Artificial Intelligence for stand-alone systems to multimedia communications for distance learning. The approach was to mobilise the different assets in this multidisciplinary field and to put them to work towards a common goal, to draw-up a common European agenda.        The results achieved led to the successful launching of the new action ''Telematics Systems for Flexible and Distance Learning''. The goal was to pave the way for the implementation of technology-based learning infrastructures which would enable Europe to reap the benefits already foreseen in the previous research. Issues such as improving performance of design and production systems, catering for more flexibility in the delivery and provision of remote access to learning resources will ease the uptake of learning technologies. Nevertheless, many questions are still open, such as which systems and technologies are best suited to the particular needs of the end-users; how the performance of these systems should be evaluated; how to build consensus on standards for the future Europe-wide delivery systems. These, among others, are the questions which the new action is striving to answer.        Systems using Broadband-ISDN, VSAT networks, computer conferencing, multimedia, hypermedia, etc. are being prototyped and tested to ascertain their suitability for learning purposes. Many possibilities are being experimented, from the intelligent simulations for on-the-job learning for individual users to the knowledge networks based on computer conferencing or virtual classrooms designed to meet the needs of distributed groups. Future learning services will make use of the technologies and systems under development, but even more importantly, several pilot experiments are committed to provide evidence of good practices, under a common evaluation framework, and consequently to provide an answer to some of the key questions stated above.

These technologies are now being experimented by the businesses to leverage their potential and minimise their risks in business operations. The continuous adoption of the emerging Generative AI technologies will help startups gain more and more experience with adoptions, helping them to leverage continuously evolving technological innovation landscape. However, there is a dearth of prior research on ChatGPT adoption in the startup context, especially from Entrepreneur perspective, highlights the urgent need for a thorough investigation to identify the variables influencing this technological adoption. The primary objective of this study is to ascertain the factors that impact the uptake of ChatGPT technology by startups, anticipate their influence on the triumph of companies, and offer pragmatic suggestions for various stakeholders, including entrepreneurs, and policymakers.Method and analysis This study attempts to explore the variables impacting startups' adoption of ChatGPT technology, with an emphasis on comprehending entrepreneurs' attitudes and perspectives. To identify and then empirically validate the Generative AI technology adoption framework, the study uses a two-stage methodology that includes experience-based research, and survey research. The research method design is descriptive and Correlational design. Stage one of the research study is descriptive and involves adding practical insights, and real-world context to the model by drawing from the professional consulting experiences of the researchers with the SMEs. The outcome of this stage is the adoption model (also called as research framework), building Upon Technology Adoption Model (TAM), that highlight the technology adoption factors (also called as latent variables) connected with subset of each other and finally to the technology adoption factor (or otherwise). Further, the latent variables and their relationships with other latent variables as graphically highlighted by the adoption model will be translated into the structured questionnaire. Stage two involves survey based research. In this stage, structured questionnaire is tested with small group of entrepreneurs (who has provided informed consent) and finally to be distributed among startup founders to further validate the relationships between these factors and the level of influence individual factors have on overall technology adoption. Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) will be used to analyze the gathered data. This multifaceted approach allows for a comprehensive analysis of the adoption process, with an emphasis on understanding, describing, and correlating the key elements at play.Discussion This is the first study to investigate the factors that impact the adoption of Generative AI, for instance ChatGPT technology by startups from the Entrepreneurs perspectives. The study's findings will give Entrepreneurs, Policymakers, technology providers, researchers, and Institutions offering support for entrepreneurs like Academia, Incubators and Accelerators, University libraries, public libraries, chambers of commerce, and foreign embassies important new information that will help them better understand the factors that encourage and hinder ChatGPT adoption.

This study aims to investigate the effect of supply chain finance (SCF) on corporate sustainability performance (CSP) and identifies SCF-related recipes for CSP. Design/methodology/approachBased on a sample of 1,038 firms that disclose CSP - namely, corporate financial performance (CFP) and environmental, social and governance performance (ESGP) - the authors use a quasi-replication method consisting of empirical analysis with fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) to investigate SCF's effects on CSP. FindingsThe authors find that SCF has a ""doing well by doing good"" effect on CSP. CFP can promote the positive effect of SCF and ESGP while ESGP's positive effect on SCF and CFP is nonsignificant. In addition, heterogeneity tests show that SCF's promoting effect on CSP is affected by high-low CFP and ESGP. The fsQCA results verify the empirical findings and reveal five SCF-related recipes for achieving high CSP. Research limitations/implicationsThis study has the following two limitations. First, we do not consider how SCF affects CSP in different industries. There is a need to investigate whether industry heterogeneity changes SCF's effects on CSP, especially in prominent industries, such as the energy industry, with its high susceptibility to ESGP, and the manufacturing industry, with its extensive application of SCF. It will be important to investigate these industries to better understand SCF's role in sustainability. Second, we study the secondary supply chain - namely, core firm-suppliers and core firm-customers. The authors do not consider financial institutions (e.g. banks and guarantee institutions). SCF modes that include the participation of financial institutions, such as factoring financing and reverse factoring financing, cater more to the capital needs of diversified firms. In the future, studying specific industries that have made significant contributions to the application of SCF along with others that are more sensitive to environmental governance could better highlight the effect of SCF on sustainability and help supply chain managers understand the application value of SCF. Future research could also extend SCF participants into multiple roles to explore separate effects. Tracking financing demanders, fund providers and credit guarantors could capture SCF characteristics more comprehensively. Methodologically, it will be challenging to accurately measure SCF networks in terms of quantification. In future work, this could be performed with the help of artificial intelligence. Practical implicationsFirst, our findings indicate that SCF has a ""doing well by doing good"" effect on core firms. SCF can not only overcome the capital shortage of SMEs but also provide significant benefits to core firms. Second, our findings provide SCF-related recipes to help firms fulfil ESGP obligations without sacrificing CFP under the pressure to ""do good."" The authors provide valuable insights and diverse recommendations to help supply chain managers, marketing executives and researchers adjust supply chain management strategies. Third, this work can guide executives in various fields to adopt SCF to achieve sustainability as a risk-mitigation strategy by means of marketing.        Originality/valueThis study identifies better, more straightforward SCF-related recipes for CSP (consisting of CFP and ESGP) using a quasi-replication analysis that improves upon conventional methods such as regression analysis, which have limited power. The authors provide valuable insights and diverse recommendations to help managers pursue sustainable development. The findings point to practical guidelines and feasible solutions that can support well-founded operational strategic and management decision-making, which can enhance a firm's competitiveness under uncertainty and a sluggish economy.",,10.1108/JBIM-03-2022-0154,Supply chain finance;Sustainability performance;Financial performance;Environmental;social and governance performance;Recipe;TRADE CREDIT;INSTITUTIONAL THEORY;IMPACT;CSR;ENTERPRISES;COMPETITION;INNOVATION;FRAMEWORK;STRATEGY;INDUSTRY,,,False,True,False,False

Int. Bus. Policy""]",7,4,466-475,"Castaldi, C",,English,,"Univ Utrecht, Dept Human Geog & Spatial Planning, Utrecht, Netherlands","Many of the debates around international business policy envision a key role for innovation. The empirical evidence feeding these debates relies, among other methods, on using innovation indicators. Several studies have exploited patent-based innovation indicators, while alternative indicators appear underexploited. In this commentary, I review the case for using trademark data to measure innovation, discussing emerging research on the validity of trademark-based indicators. The main intuition is that including such indicators in the innovation measurement toolbox allows capturing more types of innovation, happening in more firms and in more places. I outline both the case for and the case against embracing trademark-based indicators of innovation in international business research. To illustrate their potential, I discuss studies that already addressed international business research questions using trademarks and I offer examples of new research that could do so in the future, in three core research areas: (i) the global geography of innovation, (ii) cross-border activities and local innovation, (iii) MNE's innovation and public policy. The ultimate goal here is to trigger curiosity and indicate possibilities, so that the community around this journal can further experiment with measuring innovation with trademark data.        In the fast-paced world of international business, innovation is the engine that drives growth and addresses societal challenges. However, measuring innovation across different countries and industries is complex, especially when relying solely on traditional indicators like patents (legal rights granted for inventions), which mainly capture technological inventions. This study explores the potential of trademarks - symbols that protect brands and business ideas - as complementary indicators of innovation. Trademarks are used by various firms globally and can reflect innovation in products, services, and business models, offering a broader view of innovation activities.This study delves into the use of trademarks to measure innovation types and phases that patents may miss. Trademarks are intellectual property rights (legal protections for creations of the mind) like patents but are more inclusive, capturing innovation in non-technological areas and across different firm sizes and sectors. The research examines existing literature and case studies, proposing new research ideas to leverage trademark data. It also acknowledges the limitations of trademarks, such as the lack of requirement for novelty (newness), which could lead to false negatives (incorrectly identifying something as not innovative). The study is a commentary, reviewing arguments and evidence for using trademark-based indicators and suggesting future research directions.The results show that trademarks can indeed serve as valuable indicators of innovation. They help capture commercialized innovation, non-technological innovation, and activities of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Trademarks also provide a more diversified geographical coverage of innovation, revealing activities in areas often overlooked by patent-based studies. The research concludes that combining patents and trademarks can offer a richer and more accurate picture of global innovation activities.The potential impact of this research is significant. By adopting trademark-based indicators, policymakers and businesses can gain a more comprehensive understanding of innovation landscapes. This could lead to more informed decisions and strategies that support economic growth and address public policy challenges. The study encourages the international business community to experiment with these indicators, which could ultimately lead to advances in how we measure and understand innovation.This text was initially drafted using artificial intelligence, then reviewed by the author(s) to ensure accuracy.

Numerosos debates sobre las pol & iacute;ticas de negocios internacionales contemplan un papel clave para la innovaci & oacute;n. La evidencia emp & iacute;rica que nutre estos debates se basa, entre otros m & eacute;todos, en el uso de indicadores de innovaci & oacute;n. Muchos estudios han aprovechado indicadores de innovaci & oacute;n basados en patentes, mientras que los indicadores alternativos parecen ser menos aprovechados.

To understand how small and medium-sized firms have utilised Gen AI-based tools to cope with the market's high level of turbulence caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical crises, and economic slowdown, researchers have conducted an empirical study. Although Gen AI is receiving more attention, there remains a dearth of empirical studies that investigate how it influences the entrepreneurial orientation of firms and their ability to cultivate entrepreneurial resilience amidst market turbulence. Most of the literature offers anecdotal evidence. To address this research gap, the authors have grounded their theoretical model and research hypotheses in the contingent view of dynamic capability. They tested the research hypotheses using cross-sectional data from a pre-tested survey instrument, which yielded 87 useable responses from small and medium enterprises in France. The authors used variance-based structural equation modelling with the commercial WarpPLS 7.0 software to test the theoretical model. The study's findings suggest that Gen AI and EO have a significant influence on building entrepreneurial resilience as higher-order and lower-order dynamic capabilities. However, market turbulence has a negative moderating effect on the path that joins entrepreneurial orientation and entrepreneurial resilience. The results suggest that the assumption that high market turbulence will have positive effects on dynamic capabilities and competitive advantage is not always true, and the linear assumption does not hold, which is consistent with some scholars' assumptions. The study's results offer significant contributions to the contingent view of dynamic capabilities and open new research avenues that require further investigation into the non-linear relationship of market turbulence. © 2024 The Author(s)",,10.1016/j.technovation.2024.103063,Dynamic capability view;Entrepreneurial orientation;Entrepreneurial resilience;Generative AI;Market turbulence;Commerce;Competition;Enterprise resource management;Investments;Software testing;Business models;Dynamic capability view;Dynamics capability;Empirical studies;Entrepreneurial orientation;Entrepreneurial resilience;Generative AI;Market turbulence;Small business;Theoretical modeling;Turbulence,,,True,True,False,False

Modern businesses utilize AI systems to optimize their operations, make strategic decisions and to enhance quality etc. On the other hand, Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) constitute a sizeable portion of the global economy and are the main drivers of economic development. The highly saturated market of SMEs demands them to adopt innovative digital technologies to stay competitive. However, there are various challenges including ethics, transparency, privacy, biases, financial limitations, infrastructural incapacity, and others associated with the adoption of AI. Most SMEs are unable to measure AI readiness since it is a multi-faceted procedure that requires developing a multidimensional construct with variable elements. Therefore, this work proposes a Technology-Organization-Environment-Human (TOEH) framework that comprehensively captures the possible dimensions of AI readiness and their related elements. The model carries out this evaluation at the micro level by assessing the attributes of all dimensional elements for each of the four dimensions. In the pr-assessment phase, severity index for each attribute of the dimensional elements is formulated through expert review that serves as a metric to assess AI readiness. In the assessment phase, firm's capabilities are identified through a comprehensive questionnaire and each of the dimensional elements is assigned a readiness state (informal, struggling, approaching and desirable state). Based upon the state of these dimensional elements and the pre-determined severity ratings, a readiness rating is assigned to the four dimensions. The proposed model is also capable of suggesting a comprehensive action plan based on the organizational inadequacies. It is iterative that requires SMEs to reassess their readiness until it achieve the desired or required readiness state.  © 2025 The Authors.

With AI’s rapid advancement impacting productivity and efficiency across industries, understanding the challenges that SMEs face to remain competitive is crucial. Utilizing the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model as a theoretical framework, we analyzed managers, engineers, and line workers’ observations on workforce challenges, training needs, and opportunities faced by SMEs to provide insights into their smart manufacturing deployment experiences. Our findings highlight social influence’s role in promoting technology adoption, emphasizing community, shared experiences, and collaborative networks. Conversely, effort expectancy emerged as the largest inhibitor, with concerns about the complexity, time, and resources required for implementation. Individuals were also influenced by factors of facilitating conditions (organizational buy-in, infrastructure, etc.) and performance expectancy on their propensity to adopt advanced technology. By fostering positive organizational environments and communities that share success stories and challenges, we suggest this can mitigate the perceived effort expected to implement new technology.

The anticipated European AI act has a strong foundation in 7 ethical values of the Assessment List for Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence (ALTAI): human agency and oversight, technical robustness and safety, privacy and data governance, transparency, diversity, non-discrimination and fairness, environmental and societal wellbeing, and accountability. In addition, data management and privacy are other important aspects of responsible AI: from development towards implementation. In many research fields, a form of ethical management or review is common practice. However, in the field of AI and manufacturing this is relatively new. Within the EU project: Artificial Intelligence in Manufacturing for Sustainability at SMEs (AIRISE), AI experts will support SMEs active in manufacturing, in the uptake of AI by conducting tailor-made experiments. One requirement for these experiments is the management of ethics, data and privacy. At the same time, AIRISE will also deliver this as a service to SMEs. Ethics management allows for reflection on business processes, safe working and possible improvements. This work presents our way of service delivery, tutoring, training modules and review procedure, based on the ALTAI principles, GDPR and FAIR principles. Our work lays the foundations for compliance to multiple EU legislations such as the AI act and GDPR, delivered in a user-friendly service.

With the suitable S-ERPS, it is easy to give coordination between the items, reduce waste, and take quicker and better decisions. Implementation of an effective S-ERPS is one of the major investment decisions for any firm; thus, the selection of suitable S-ERPS requires major attention from the experts. Due to involvement of several aspects of sustainability, the S-ERPS selection process can be considered as a complex uncertain multicriteria decision making problem. The aim of this work is to develop a four-stage hybrid decision support system (DSS) by integrating the symmetry point of criterion (SPC), ranking comparison (RANCOM), and multiattribute multiobjective optimization based on ratio assessment (MULTIMOORA) approaches with q-rung orthopair fuzzy rough set (q-ROFRS), named as q-ROFR-SPC-RANCOM-MULTIMOORA. The underlying DSS consists of four main stages: first, new q-ROFR-Hamacher aggregation operators are developed to aggregate the q-ROFRSs; second, q-ROFR-score rating and rank sum model is given to find the significance weights of decision experts; third, an integrated q-ROFR-SPC-RANCOM model is developed to determine the weights of sustainability dimensions and criteria for S-ERPSs; and fourth, a hybrid q-ROFR-MULTIMOORA model is presented to evaluate and rank the S-ERPSs. To exhibit the feasibility of the developed DSS, a case study is discussed to evaluate the S-ERPS in small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The developed DSS effectively prioritized the S-ERPS options and recognized the suitable S-ERPS using the information obtained from various SMEs. In this study, the evaluation criteria are categorized into social, environmental, and economic dimensions with the expert's opinions. The results indicate that cost, environmental grievance mechanisms, and technical requirements are the most effective sustainable factors, and SAP ERP is the most suitable alternative among others. The robustness and superiority of the developed DSS is evaluated by means of sensitivity and comparative analyses.

It critically examines various stakeholders, their barriers and drivers, and the difficulties in benchmarking and verifying energy savings in SMEs’ energy efficiency projects. By addressing these issues, the paper proposes integrating drivers into one sustainable business model. It maps them in a triple-layer business canvas model (TLBCM) to highlight the comprehensive value proposition of utilising these drivers in an integrated way. This new business model is strategically designed to address economic, environmental, and social aspects of energy efficiency, making it a robust solution for SMEs. Economically, it reduces financial burdens by creating innovative financing mechanisms and dual revenue streams from energy sales and savings. Environmentally, it advocates for producing and using green energy at SME locations, contributing to the sector’s decarbonization. Socially, the model fosters trust and collaboration among stakeholders, enhancing the commitment to energy-saving practices and generating significant social benefits. By offering a structured approach that combines economic viability with environmental responsibility and social impact, this model emerges as a pioneering solution in the European energy efficiency market, highlighting the importance of data mining to develop digital platforms that can enhance feasibility, cost-benefit analysis, lifecycle analysis, environmental impact assessment and benchmarking capabilities for micro and macro energy efficiency projects utilising the proposed TLBCM. This facilitates sustainable energy efficiency practices among SMEs and can set a benchmark for future energy efficiency initiatives, demonstrating the effectiveness of integrated approaches in achieving sustainable development goals. This paper contributes to the field by proposing a novel TLBCM for an integrated approach to address the multifaceted challenges in the SME energy efficiency sector.

As China promotes the digital transformation of industries, understanding how the investment in AI by small and micro enterprises (SMEs) affects labor demand, which is inextricably linked to “stable employment”, becomes an important question. This paper uses special data from 127 SMEs in 14 provinces from 2016 to 2020 and employs a two-way fixed effects model to study the impact of AI inputs on enterprises’ labor demand. The empirical results show that the impact of AI inputs on the labor demand of SMEs is not significant overall, but shows a significant negative effect in non-state-owned enterprises, private enterprises, and high-tech enterprises. There is a significant difference in the impact of AI inputs on the labor demand of different industries, with only the wholesale and retail industry demonstrating a significant positive impact. From the results of mechanism analysis, the substitution effect and creation effect of AI inputs on labor demand coexist, and in general, these two effects cancel each other out. However, the substitution effect dominates in some types of enterprises and industries. Finally, this paper discusses the government and enterprise coping strategies for the employment impact of AI applications based on empirical evidence and research results. This paper not only theoretically demonstrates that the impact of AI investment on firms' labor demand is uncertain, but also empirically demonstrates that Chinese firms' AI investment does not significantly affect firms' overall labor demand. This facilitates the government and enterprises to formulate strategies that can enhance the level of enterprise intelligence without impacting the labor market. © 2024 The Authors",,10.1016/j.heliyon.2024.e33893,AI inputs;Creation effect;Labor demand;SMEs;Substitution effect,,,True,True,False,False

The authors utilized a quantitative method, using a survey instrument for this research. Data for this research were collected from managers working in six different sectors. Subsequently, based on company size, firms were divided into two groups, allowing multi-group analysis of small and medium-sized businesses to explore group differences. Hence, firm size played a moderating role in the conceptualized model. Data analysis was performed on SmartPLS 3, and the results suggest that dimensions of the TOE framework, such as relative advantage, compatibility, sustainable human capital, market and customer demand, and government support, play a significant role in the adoption of AI. Moreover, this study found a significant influence of AI on SMEs’ operational and economic performance. The multi-group analysis (MGA) results reveal significant group differences, with a medium-sized firm strengthening the relationship between relative advantage and AI adoption compared to small-size firms.

Questionnaires were distributed among 159 SME owners in Kediri, East Java, Indonesia. Hypotheses were tested using PLS-SEM. The results indicate that the adoption of the Internet of Things demonstrates a significant positive effect (p = 0.0000, T-statistic = 4.6695), improving real-time monitoring and operational efficiency. Blockchain also positively affects SME internationalization (p-value = 0.0085, T-statistic = 2.6427), enhancing supply chain transparency and ensuring compliance with international standards. In contrast, the influence of artificial intelligence is marginally significant (p = 0.0799, T-statistic = 1.7548), constrained by financial limitations and lack of expertise. The moderating effects of eco-digital learning show mixed results. It significantly moderates the relationship between the Internet of Things and internationalization in a negative direction (coefficient = –0.0651, p = 0.0475), suggesting that increased eco-digital learning may add complexity, potentially delaying the benefits of the Internet of Things. For blockchain, eco-digital learning enhances its positive impact (p = 0.0277, T-statistic = 2.2085) by strengthening the organization’s ability to leverage transparency and sustainability. However, no significant moderating effect is observed for artificial intelligence (p = 0.2066, T-statistic = 1.2646), indicating limited integration due to resource constraints.

Pioneering companies that are early adopters of AI for NPD have reaped substantial rewards, seeing notable reductions in development timelines and a heightened pace of innovation. These are larger firms like Siemens, GE, Nestle, and Pfizer; but what about the more typical or smaller firm? To address this question, we surveyed Irish small-to-medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), organized by the Innovation and Research Development Group (IRDG) in Ireland. This article unveils the study's findings, shedding light on the current implementation status of AI across 13 crucial applications in NPD. It also delves into the SMEs' intentions to adopt AI in their NP processes in the foreseeable future, along with the improvements that AI has already brought. Importantly, the study also focuses on SMEs' readiness to adopt AI for NPD, the most important metrics gauging readiness, and possible causes of hesitancy to adopt AI. SMEs in the study have not implemented AI across any of the 13 possible application areas in NPD to a great extent, and the intent-to-adopt is also not strong. Performance results from deploying AI in NPD to date are modest, averaging about 27 % improvement on each of the five KPIs. Further, SMEs' readiness-to-adopt AI for NPD reveals that they are not strongly committed to moving ahead with AI in NPD for a variety of reasons, including the high costs of acquiring AI; challenges in building a strong business case; cybersecurity and IP risks; and recent AI failures. The urgency to act and embrace AI in NPD becomes evident as we uncover the immense potential it holds for propelling businesses into a future of enhanced productivity, efficiency, and innovation. © 2025 The Author",,10.1016/j.indmarman.2025.01.016,Adoption of AI;Artificial intelligence;New product development;Product innovation;Readiness to adopt,,,True,True,False,False

Consequently, this study investigates the influence of the independent variable—marketing artificial intelligence—comprising its dimensions: data mining, data processing, and big data, on the dependent variable, organisational renewal. In line with this objective, the study adopts a quantitative approach, which, although not inherently ideal for survey-based research, operates on the premise that data can be gathered from a population (or, in this case, a sample) through a structured questionnaire. The research concentrates on small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) functioning within the Iraqi context, specifically targeting the city of Najaf, where the business environment is rapidly evolving and characterised by dynamism. The questionnaire was administered to employees within the selected organisations, deliberately excluding managerial staff to ensure the accuracy and impartiality of the findings. The results indicate that marketing artificial intelligence, along with its components—data mining, data processing, and big data—significantly contributes to the organisational renewal of Iraqi SMEs. Accordingly, the study recommends that organisations prioritise the adoption and integration of marketing artificial intelligence, given its substantial impact not only on organisational renewal but also across various facets of organisational functioning. © 2024, International Forum of Management Scholars.

A robust legal framework is essential as AI enterprises navigate issues like algorithmic bias, misinformation, privacy violations, and regulatory inconsistencies. This paper examines how business structures—Godo-Kaisha in Japan and Limited Liability Companies (LLCs) and Series LLCs in the U.S.—shape liability exposure and corporate governance in AI enterprises. A key contribution of this study is its focus on legal structures as a foundation for AI’s social implementation. Granting legal status to AI service businesses enables the assignment of rights and obligations, ensuring effective risk allocation, governance, and regulatory compliance. This highlights the interaction between business law and AI governance in fostering responsible innovation. Through comparative legal analysis, this paper explores how liability structures influence AI governance, corporate accountability, and ethical compliance. It examines the EU AI Act’s dual-axis risk classification and emerging governance models such as the OECD AI Principles and the G7 Hiroshima AI Process, with Series LLCs proposed as a novel approach to fluctuating AI risks. This paper addresses three key research questions: (1) Impact of AI risks on liability exposure for business participants.

While green practices are essential to a company and its environment, they have their pain points – “The initial investment required for sustainable technologies and practices can be high, posing a challenge for small and medium-sized enterprises.” To address these challenges, this paper proposes a platform that involves a decentralized and collaborative ecosystem involving three primary stakeholders: SBTi certificate holders, Small and Medium Enterprises(SMEs), and green investors. SBTi certificate holders are rewarded with digital rewards for validated sustainable activities who upon reaching a threshold, gain ownership of virtual spaces to support bootstrapping startups. Virtual space is a conceptual digital environment comprising of SMEs to contribute a reduced number of rewards to the space owners, building their token reserves in exchange of certificates affiliated with space owners. Investors can discover these certified SMEs using AI-driven search engines calibrated to investor preferences. To ensure data integrity and transparency, each transaction—including rewards, ownership records of virtual spaces, and agreements between stakeholders is validated through PoS consensus protocols and recorded on the blockchain. Certificates are securely stored on the IPFS, hashed using SHA-256, and linked to the blockchain. UiPath automates key workflows, such as verifying SBTi holders and triggering blockchain endpoints.

The research was conducted based on a comprehensive survey encompassing a sample of 473 SMEs and large Slovenian enterprises. Methods: To validate the observed differences, statistical analysis, specifically the Mann–Whitney U test, was employed. Results: The results confirm the presence of statistically significant differences between SMEs and large enterprises across multiple dimensions of AI support in project management. Large enterprises exhibit on average a higher level of AI adoption across all five AI utilization dimensions. Specifically, large enterprises scored significantly higher (p < 0.05) in AI adopting strategies and in adopting AI technologies for project tasks and team creation. This study’s findings also underscored the significant differences (p < 0.05) between SMEs and large enterprises in their adoption and utilization of AI technologies for project management purposes. While large enterprises scored above 4 for several dimensions, with the highest average score assessed (mean value 4.46 on 1 to 5 scale) for the usage of predictive Analytics Tools to improve the work on the project, SMEs’ average levels, on the other hand, were all below 4. SMEs in particular may lag in incorporating AI into various project activities due to several factors such as resource constraints, limited access to AI expertise, or risk aversion.

The solution to this issue is friendly management of the environment. With the rapid growth of Chinese Manufacturing SMEs for economic development, environmental pollution and abuse of resources are arising. To resolve these issues, Chinese manufacturing SMEs are accelerating the implementation of green innovation in their industries. However, it is a complex task that involves enterprise, government, and social considerations. Therefore, it is essential to identify the green drivers for this implementation. With a focus on China's current situation from previous research and views from experts, this study aims to investigate how Chinese Manufacturing Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) are responding to resource misuse and environmental pollution by implementing green innovation, emphasising the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in improving environmental performance. This study primarily looks into the factors that influence the adoption of green innovations by analysing the growth paths of Chinese SMEs operating in highly polluting industries over a longer time frame than five years. Artificial Intelligence is a valuable tool for solving the issues of ecological degradation. A quantitative method has been implemented for the Chinese companies' samples from the deeply polluting industries for more than five years. The findings of this paper advise that the average board size, the governing board meetings, and organizational performance are positively connected with the Chinese firms' environmental process. Board independence and diversity of gender have irrelevant associations with ecological performance. A convenient threshold regression model has been used to accumulate the respondents' data. It also reveals that larger board sizes and more frequent governing board meetings are positively associated with improved environmental performance among these firms. The findings state the critical implications for the firm executives, policymakers, environmental activists, and regulators.

While the drivers and barriers to AI adoption have been extensively studied, there is a lack of scientific publications on AI adoption in digital marketing (DM) among Malaysian SMEs. This study examines how perceived usefulness (PU), perceived ease-of-use (PEOU), and perceived barriers (PB) influence the intention to adopt AI in Malaysian SMEs. Data from 301 valid questionnaires were analyzed using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM) on SmartPLS 4.0. The results show that these factors explain 23 % of the variance in AI adoption intention. PU is the strongest driver, while PEOU has a weaker but significant effect. PB significantly hinders adoption, indicating the need to address technological, organizational, and market challenges. The weak but significant relationship between PU and PEOU suggests that businesses do not necessarily equate ease of use with usefulness, implying that AI solutions should be marketed based on their tangible business value rather than just user-friendliness. These findings provide practical guidance for businesses and policymakers aiming to promote AI adoption in the digital marketing sector.

Based on the Flash Eurobarometer 486, this paper analyses how the adoption of artificial intelligence and robots is related to European SMEs carrying out product, process, organizational and marketing innovations. Our results establish scale-ups and start-ups as the most likely adopters of these technologies and the most innovative firms. Furthermore, internal characteristics, such as internationalization and firm size, and external factors, such as the availability of digital skills and infrastructure, are significant drivers of digitalization at the firm level. In a two-stage approach, we find that the adoption of artificial intelligence and robots is associated with all innovation types, although these technologies serve more specialised objectives in manufacturing rather than in service sectors. Our results confirm a significant variability in the adoption of artificial intelligence and robots, as well as heterogeneous associations with innovation outcomes. © The Author(s) 2025.",,10.1007/s11187-025-01017-2,Artificial intelligence;Innovation;Robots;SMEs,,,True,True,False,False

Globally, larger businesses have used BDA to collect, study, and evaluate vast volumes of data to identify market trends and insights that lead to sound and intelligent business decisions. However, its adoption in small and medium enterprises (SMEs) is not fully maximized because of a variety of factors, including a lack of expertise and financial repercussions. As such, this paper seeks to delve into the predictors of BDA adoption intention among SMEs in a developing nation by extending the technology acceptance model (TAM). The quantitative surveys obtained from 438 SMEs were analyzed using partial least squares and structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). The results revealed that perceived benefits, namely system quality, information quality, and predictive analytics accuracy, had positive relationships with perceived ease of use and usefulness, subsequently leading to attitude towards using BDA. Likewise, perceived security significantly influences perceived benefits, perceived ease of use, and attitude towards use of BDA. Further, attitude towards use was the most significant predictor of intention to adopt BDA among SMEs. Generally, the study indicates a positive interest in adopting BDA among Philippine SMEs. © (2025), (Universitas Ahmad Dahlan).

Utilizing dynamic capabilities and resource dependency theories, we provide a comprehensive and integral analysis of the drivers that facilitate AI adoption in SMEs. We conducted an empirical study encompassing 12,108 SMEs, based on survey data of the Flash Eurobarometer database from the European Union. Our analysis employed a combination of classical regression methods and advanced machine learning techniques, including artificial neural networks and tree regression. Our findings highlight the importance of digital capabilities in driving AI adoption, where complementing innovation capabilities exhibit synergistic effects. Contrary to prevailing literature, business environmental support alone demonstrates limited impact, emphasizing its contingent effectiveness within a well-elaborated institutional framework. Furthermore, the synergy between business environmental support and digital and innovation capabilities has a significant impact on AI adoption in SMEs. However, internal capabilities exert a greater influence on AI adoption in SMEs compared to business environmental support. This study contributes to dynamic capabilities theory by elucidating the interplay of digital and innovation capabilities, offering a nuanced understanding of their combined influence on AI adoption. It also enriches resource dependency theory by highlighting the dynamic nature of business environmental support. For practitioners, our results underscore the need for a balanced investment in digital and innovation capabilities.

Based on a game with three financing options (bank financing, guarantee financing and direct financing), we investigate how AI influences financing preferences among e-commerce supply chain participants, which involve one capital-constrained and regretful SME, one e-commerce platform, and a bank. Firstly, our findings reveal that the impact of AI is not a clear-cut matter. AI may not consistently boost platform profitability under guarantee financing, platform needs to consider the production scale effect brought by AI against the potential default risk. Similarly, in direct financing, SME must strike a balance between the increase in output resulting from AI development and the potential impact of platform adjusting interest rates. Secondly, from the perspective of financing strategy space, it's evident that AI can be a positive force in encouraging all supply chain participants to enjoy platform financing services. Specifically, SME prefers direct financing over guarantor financing when the unit regret bias cost and production cost is low but the commission fee is high. Platform is more inclined to provide direct financing if unit production cost is low and unit commission fee is high. Otherwise, bank financing is preferred. As regret bias cost diminish, the strategy space for bank financing contracts. For the whole supply chain, all three types of financing may be options. Guarantee and direct financing gradually become more popular as SME uses AI at higher levels. Moreover, conclusions remain robust when SME is fully credit-constrained or platform is fully financially constrained. These results not only underscore the critical role of AI in regret bias and financial management but also shed light on the innovative possibilities in financing within the e-commerce supply chain. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",,10.1016/j.tre.2024.103649,AI;E-commerce supply chain;Financing strategy;Regret bias;Costs;Electronic commerce;Clear cuts;Commerce platforms;E- commerces;E-commerce supply chain;Financing platforms;Financing strategies;Production scale;Regret bias;Scale effects;Strategy space;artificial intelligence;electronic commerce;finance;small and medium-sized enterprise;supply chain management;Supply chains,,,True,True,False,False

The empirical evidence collected from interviews with key stakeholders, practitioners’ forums, and public company documents yields two distinct approaches that differ in their potential for accelerating innovation and reducing the concept-product gap. From a contingency perspective, these two approaches are expanded into four distinct development process configurations, contingent on the business development stage, reliance on 3rd party platforms, availability of high volumes of data, investment level, organisational agility, and level of novelty. The resulting process typology could be used as a diagnostic tool for FinTech SMEs interested in effectively leveraging AI innovation. Using contingency theory, we further develop these insights into a new theoretical framework to explain how AI innovation development unfolds in FinTech SMEs and the rationale for different implementations. Our new process typology and theoretical model can help researchers investigate the mechanisms underlying technological innovation processes. We further identify the specific reasons why the potential of AI for creating new services and disrupting incumbents via digital startups has not been fully realised even in contexts with significant investment and support from public and private business development programmes.

In fact, one area the effects of technologies have been felt is the economy and the commercial sector. Technologies have continued impact and improve businesses across the world, and commercial activities have drifted towards the power and whims of the contemporary technological realities. Hence, many big businesses are adjusting their operations to utilise these new tools for productivity and profitability; affording them enormous competitive advantages. However, studies have showed that SMEs cannot afford expensive technologies or lack the financial wherewithal to adopt technological innovations. Worse still, SMEs in the developing nations contend with several challenges, and it has been determined that more than 80% of SMEs collapse or die during their first three years. The informal sector in every nation is key to the survival of every country, and if struggling nations continue to experience high business mortality in the informal sector, then the economy of the developing countries will continue to nosedive. Therefore, this work recognizes the transformative power of artificial intelligence and its potentials to improve SMEs.

Despite their relevance, financial issues represent an area scarcely considered in relation to the tourism industry: the topic has so far remained totally unexplored. Zombie firms cause great damage to the sector in which they compete. However, there is no consensus regarding what actions should be applied to them due to the negative consequences of maintaining or liquidating them. In view of this, the key issue is to prevent them from entering the zombie state. It would therefore be useful to have a methodology for predicting years in advance when a company will become a zombie firm.

Quality, as a main concern in manufacturing, is also to benefit from this change of paradigm by introducing new key enabling technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) into quality management, earning it the label of Quality 4.0 (Q4.0). The implementation of these paradigms is still gathering research efforts as it is arduous to design and realize effective end-to-end Decision Support Systems (DSSs) for Q4.0, with several dimensions to consider when integrating digitalization with quality. This is an even more challenging task when it comes to SMEs’ efforts to implement these concepts, given the particularities of these entities. This paper presents an approach to design a Total Manufacturing Quality 4.0 (TMQ 4.0) DSS by combining Sensor Network (SN) data and historical data in an end-to-end framework. Furthermore, the paper presents the validation of the approach through a case study application in a metal-cutting high-precision manufacturing SME.

Despite the potential advantages of cost reductions associated with office space and flexible working environments, this model presents difficulties in effectively controlling and monitoring employee work activities. Applying advanced technologies in human resources can enable organizations to address these challenges effectively. However, SMEs face challenges in adopting advanced technologies such as AI and facial recognition due to financial constraints, lack of technical expertise, and concerns about cost-effectiveness. The paper focuses on developing a low-cost attendance monitoring mobile application that utilizes real-time facial recognition and location analysis for SMEs. We try to enhance the real-time registration and identification flow with the camera of employees' mobiles by handling large data streams and integrating the system with a cloud-based solution. First, the AI facial detection module uses the camera on mobile devices as input devices to ensure the flexibility of face recognition data input. The AI Engine layer is built by applying a deep learning-based facial recognition model that was trained using a large dataset of collected employee faces. Employees' facial identities using the Resnet34 model integrated Additive Angular Margin Loss function to identify employees' facial identities. The facial recognition model is designed to operate in real-time, with the ability to detect and identify employees as they check in and out of the workplace. Finally, we demonstrate an experimental prototype on a mobile phone application using React Native, NodeJS, and Python. The mobile application is designed to operate on both iOS and Android platforms, ensuring widespread accessibility for SMEs. The experimental findings provide empirical evidence that our system exhibits accuracy and efficiency in the tasks of facial identification and personnel matching.

Improving on existing research and its methodological limitations, we provide an understanding of the digital transformation in SMEs by approaching the research from a non-linear and complex perspective. We empirically test our hypotheses using the Eurostat Flash Eurobarometer No. 486 data set, with a final sample of 16,365 SMEs. Our first contribution shows that an adequate understanding of digital transformation not only implies the identification of drivers of digitalisation but also a grasp of how these drivers act, highlighting the differential effect that internal capabilities and external support of the company in interaction have on digital transformation. Moreover, the results show that the effect of interactions between variables is transferred to the output variable in a non-linear process, which may contain an optimum produced by a differential combination of input variables. Second, the paper extends the research methodology, emphasising the importance of combining classic regression analysis with machine-learning techniques. Thus, using a systemic approach, we conclude that the combination of the explanatory power of regression models and machine learning allows us to quantify and explain how variables act, solving complex and non-linear problems. © 2023 The Authors",,10.1016/j.techfore.2023.122880,Artificial intelligence;Digitalisation;Dynamics;SME;System dynamics;Linear transformations;Machine learning;Statistical tests;Data set;Differential effect;Digital transformation;Digitalization;Input variables;Non linear;Nonlinear process;Output variables;SME;System Dynamics;artificial intelligence;data set;empirical analysis;machine learning;nonlinearity;small and medium-sized enterprise;Regression analysis,,,True,True,False,False

Therefore, accurately predicting early signs of financial distress in SMEs and taking timely management improvement actions is of paramount importance. However, there is a lack of research on developing multi-class financial distress prediction (MFDP) models specifically for SMEs. Moreover, traditional MFDP models often lack interpretability. To address this, this study proposes definitions for multi-class financial distress in SMEs and constructs a MFDP model using machine learning. Additionally, it introduces an explainable framework to interpret the constructed model. Specifically, the study classifies SMEs' financial conditions into three categories: healthy, mild financial distress, and severe financial distress. It conducts a comparative analysis of six machine learning models. Furthermore, it proposes new interpretation methods for the MFDP model using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and counterfactual explanations (CE), both of which are explainable artificial intelligence techniques. The empirical results reveal that the MFDP model, which adjusts data balance using random oversampling and integrates LightGBM with a one-versus-rest decomposition method, demonstrates the highest performance. Moreover, the proposed explainable framework demonstrates that it can provide practical and concrete improvement strategies to the model users, such as managers and financial institutions. © 2024 IEEE.",,10.1109/BigData62323.2024.10825908,counterfactual explanations;explainable artificial intelligence;multi-class financial distress prediction;small and medium enterprises;Decentralized finance;Machine learning;Prediction models;Counterfactual explanation;Counterfactuals;Explainable artificial intelligence;Financial distress;Financial distress prediction;Financial distress prediction model;Global economies;Multi-class financial distress prediction;Small-and-medium enterprise;Value creation;Learning systems,,,True,True,False,False

This paper focuses on small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and examines how they can achieve an optimal psychological balance when using AI. The goal is to encourage employees to adopt AI while maintaining critical thinking and autonomy. This research paper uses theoretical analysis as the research method, drawing on established psychological theories such as the Technology Acceptance Model and the Job Demands-Resources Model. The findings are used to propose a model for determining an optimal balance for SMEs. The analysis reveals several psychological barriers related to anxiety, which can lead to increased stress, lower motivation, and general resistance to the use of AI tools. Conversely, once the fear is overcome, there is a risk of over-reliance on AI. Therefore, it is important to provide training that helps employees recognize the benefits of AI and its impact on their tasks, critically evaluate AI recommendations, and find a balance between automated guidance with human judgement. Finding the optimal balance in the use of AI is critical. Fostering a culture of continuous learning, and adaptability, together with supportive leadership, can help maintain this balance. In summary, through a strategic application of psychological theories, SMEs can harness the potential of AI to improve work performance and mitigate labour shortages while developing motivated and critically thinking employees. © Proceedings of the 4th International Conference on AI Research, ICAIR 2024.",,,Artificial intelligence;Critical thinking;Model;Organisation;Psychological barriers;Technology acceptance;Business sector;Critical thinking;Optimal balance;Psychological barrier;Psychological theory;Research method;Research papers;Small and medium-sized enterprise;Technology acceptance;Technology acceptance model,,,True,True,False,False

Organizations and HR departments increasingly adopt artificial intelligence solutions to streamline recruitment and selection procedures. By doing so, SMEs can improve operational efficiency while enabling human resource (HR) specialists to focus on crucial tasks, enhancing candidate experience throughout the recruitment process. However, adopting artificial intelligence (AI) in recruitment remains limited among SMEs. We can attribute this to various factors, including a need for more capacity among SME managers to evaluate and leverage AI’s potential and concerns related to costs and risks associated with its implementation. Given that SMEs constitute 90% of businesses and contribute over 50% of global employment, it is crucial to address this issue and research ways to enhance recruitment processes specifically tailored for SMEs.

This diversification leads to a decline in efficiency owing to the complexity in pick and stow operations, as traditional systems, digital solutions, and optimization methods mainly rely on historical data without incorporating near-real-time process information. Conventional approaches separate pick and stow operations in both process and workforce, culminating in extended process durations. Instead, data-driven AI-based methods offer a solution by clustering and combining pick and stow operations into optimized bundles, considering travel distance and time. The research employs AI algorithms to streamline picking and stowing, aiming to enhance logistics performance by reducing travel distance and time. Due to the absence of real data, a simulation-based procedure to generate synthetic test and training data is adopted. The real-world logistics system of the learning factory Werk150 is modeled in AnyLogic simulation software to carry out picking and stowing in a 3D warehouse layout. This database is leveraged to train an unsupervised machine learning model using the data analytics software TensorFlow by applying algorithms focused on clustering and combination. A comparative study of these algorithms is conducted to pinpoint optimal strategies for improving logistics performance. Future research will target this methodology, which will be enriched by experimental tests in Werk150 involving near-real-time data, practical investigations, and the use of real data to conclude with an analysis to validate the optimization strategies' effectiveness. © 2024 IEEE.",,10.1109/CASE59546.2024.10711570,Software testing;Travel time;Batch sizes;Clustering combination;Clusterings;Customisation;Industrial sector;Logistic performance;Short product;Solution concepts;Travel distance;Travel-time;Unsupervised learning,,,True,False,True,False

However, the focus of previous research and AI applications has therefore mostly been on large enterprises. This poses a particular issue, as the vastly different starting conditions of various company sizes, such as data availability, play a central role in the context of AI. For this reason, our systematic literature review, based on the PRISMA protocol, consolidates the state of the art of AI with an explicit focus on SMEs and highlights the perceived challenges regarding implementation in this company size. This allowed us to identify various business activities that have been scarcely considered. Simultaneously, it led to the discovery of a total of 27 different challenges perceived by SMEs in the adoption of AI. This enables SMEs to apply the identified challenges to their own AI projects in advance, preventing the oversight of any potential obstacles or risks. The lack of knowledge, costs, and inadequate infrastructure are perceived as the most common barriers to implementation, addressing social, economic, and technological aspects in particular. This illustrates the need for a wide range of support for SMEs regarding an AI introduction, which covers various subject areas, like funding and advice, and differentiates between company sizes. © 2024, The Author(s).",,10.1007/s11301-024-00405-4,Artificial intelligence;Barriers;Manufacturing;PESTEL;SMEs,,,True,True,False,False

In order to reduce costs, batch purchasing must be performed and this requires forecasting of products to be purchased as well as their quantities. We also need to take into account storage costs, shelf life of products and the reduction of the value of certain products (e.g., electronic items) over time. This requires a combination of accurate forecasting and opti-mized inventory management. We investigate both traditional and Machine Learning (ML) based approaches. Our results indicate that, although the ML models were generally good, the traditional models (such as seasonal naive and Holt-Winters) outperformed them in many cases due to the limited data available.

To draw the main conclusions, the implementation of artificial intelligence at Polish enterprises, including in the context of their financial performance, namely the level of return on assets and the level of debt, was analysed. The study showed that the introduction of artificial intelligence technology in small and medium-sized enterprises should lead to an improvement in their financial performance, as well as the subsequent more active introduction of other innovations. The study also showed that artificial intelligence is being used quite actively in various sectors of the economy and different areas of business. This study concluded that companies can also face other types of problems that are not related to the lack of funding and the burden of this kind in general: difficulties may also arise in the field of human resources management, namely in the context of the lack of professionalism of managers and employees in the implementation of this kind of technology.

We conclude with some practical and theoretical implications. © Proceedings of the 4th International Conference on AI Research, ICAIR 2024.",,,Adoption of artificial intelligence;AI research and development;Artificial intelligence;Data autonomy;Ecosystems;SME (small to medium-sized business);Adoption of artificial intelligence;Artificial intelligence research;Artificial intelligence research and development;Data autonomy;Ecosystem theory;Medium sized enterprise;Medium-sized business;Medium-sized enterprise;Research and development;Small medium-sized enterprise (small to medium-sized business),,,True,True,False,True

Traditional risk assessment models, which mainly rely on financial data, inadequately predict such crises, as evidenced by the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in 2023. To address this issue, we developed RisQNet, a model that uses temporal graph networks to incorporate diverse risks, including real-time media influences. This approach not only advances risk prediction through news feature extraction and large language models but also enhances risk management strategies with intuitive visualization tools. Validated on a dataset with a total loan volume of USD 3 trillion, RisQNet outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline and achieves 87.1% of AUC. Our collaborative effort with financial regulators and the SME community underpins the model's development, aligning with the UN SDG 8.

In this context, large-scale empirical evidence of the economic performance implications of adopting AI is poor, especially in the context of Small and Medium Sized Enterprises (SMEs). Drawing upon the Resource-Based View and the Digital Complementary Asset literature, we assessed whether the adoption of AI affects SMEs’ revenue growth. Design/methodology/approach: First, we examine the relationship between the adoption of AI and SMEs’ revenue growth. Second, we assess whether AI complements the Internet of Things (IoT) and Big Data Analytics (BDA). We use firm-level data from the European Commission in 2020 on 11,429 European SMEs (Flash Eurobarometer 486). Findings: Among the key findings, we found that ceteris paribus, the adoption of AI positively affects SMEs’ revenue growth and, in conjunction with IoT and BDA, appears to be even more beneficial. Originality/value: Our results suggest that AI fosters SME growth, especially in combination with IoT and BDA. Thus, SME managers should be aware of the positive impacts of investments in AI and make decisions accordingly. Likewise, policymakers are aware of the positive effects of SMEs’ reliance on AI, so they may design policies and funding schemes to push this digitalization of SMEs further. © 2024, Lorenzo Ardito, Raffaele Filieri, Elisabetta Raguseo, Claudio Vitari.",,10.1108/INTR-02-2024-0195,Artificial intelligence;Big data analytics;Europe;Internet of things;Revenue growth;Small and medium sized enterprises,,,True,True,False,False

The crisis accelerated adoption of new technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) which could help to improve business processes and evolve new business models, products and services. This exploratory research reports on a preliminary survey with 81 SME owners from various sectors who undertook a seven-week programme to build foundational knowledge on the opportunities of AI for their business and sector. Of those surveyed, 49% turned to AI due to the impact of Covid-19 on their business, sector, and economy. Our results demonstrate the extent of changes small businesses have made as a result of the pandemic, for example, 64% expanded existing services and developed new products and services, with 45% expanding existing product lines. We anticipate the research will directly contribute to existing knowledge by challenging prevailing beliefs about productivity and the role of digital technology adoption. We show that by contributing to the limited literature on micro-enterprise digital technology adoption and demonstrating how a dual approach of implementation of cutting-edge technologies and new management practices can help overcome repercussions of global crises.

Demand forecasting is one of the biggest challenges of post-pandemic logistics. It appears that logistics management based on demand prediction can be a suitable alternative to the just-in-time concept. This study aims to identify the effectiveness of AI-based and statistical forecasting models versus practice-based models for SMEs and large enterprises in practice. The study compares the effectiveness of the practice-based Prophet model with the statistical forecasting models, models based on artificial intelligence, and hybrid models developed in the academic environment. Since most of the hybrid models, and the ones based on artificial intelligence, were developed within the last ten years, the study also answers the question of whether the new models have better accuracy than the older ones. The models are evaluated using a multicriteria approach with different weight settings for SMEs and large enterprises. The results show that the Prophet model has higher accuracy than the other models on most time series. At the same time, the Prophet model is slightly less computationally demanding than hybrid models and models based on artificial neural networks. On the other hand, the results of the multicriteria evaluation show that while statistical methods are more suitable for SMEs, the prophet forecasting method is very effective in the case of large enterprises with sufficient computing power and trained predictive analysts. © 2022, Centre of Sociological Research.

Consequently, artificial intelligence is no longer exclusive to large corporations; it now impacts businesses of all sizes, including small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), serving as a tool for command in the production and communication of crucial business aspects. This article delves into the extent of Communicative AI adoption by SMEs in Indonesia, shedding light on issues related to implementing industrial AI applications. To achieve this, a sample of SMEs participated in a structured online survey. Currently, AI adoption among SMEs in Indonesia is minimal. The reluctance is primarily attributed to high costs, extended duration, and inherent risks of developing proprietary applications. Instead, SMEs are heavily relying on AI-as-a-service and other cloud-based solutions. Various factors contribute to businesses' hesitancy. The slow progress in SME implementation indicates misunderstandings related to data and a lack of knowledge, influencing how these enterprises perceive the obstacles they encounter. © 2023, Innovative Information Science and Technology Research Group.

However, their integration also presents technical difficulties, financial constraints, data privacy and security concerns, and inherent CAI limitations. The study results provide a nuanced understanding of CAI’s role in SMEs, offering insights into practical applications, potential benefits, and hurdles. The findings highlight SMEs’ need to strategically approach AI implementation, balancing the potential benefits and associated challenges. The key conclusion drawn from this study is that the strategic and well-planned adoption of CAI can significantly benefit SMEs.

The aim is to avoid regulatory friction and fragmentation and to create a well-functioning internal market for AI systems and technologies. However, the policy and regulatory choices should not obstruct the innovative potential and transformative impact of AI systems and technologies on the society and economy.

One of the main pillars of this paradigm is Zero defect manufacturing (ZDM), which aims to get workpieces “right the first time”. However, this technological uplift can prove itself to be very challenging in an industrial environment especially when it comes to the choice of available sensors, the motivation behind that choice, and the insurance that they comply with different guidelines for further exploitation in decision support.

SMEs in particular, with their limited resources and significant backlog in terms of the digitalisation of corporate processes, find themselves in a digital talent trap which threatens to grow ever larger as digitalisation progresses. In other words, the digital talent gap could become a digital talent trap for SMEs in terms of digitalisation. The aim of this work is to derive from this insight a pragmatic and cost-effective solution which, in addition to the highly competitive ""buy"" option - i.e., classic recruitment via the labour market - offers a ""make"" option for SMEs that focuses more on their own employee resources. The research approach was based on two steps. In the first step, various literature approaches for recording and measuring digital skills were analysed in order to summarise them and derive potential digital talent profiles. The second step was to search for suitable software packages that are able to detect these profiles or skills in company documents. With these data sets, an analysis was carried out in the third step using AI algorithms - created in Python - in order to identify potential digital talents. An anonymised personal data set was used to test the above decision-making process. The findings show that SMEs could already access powerful, user-friendly and low-cost digital AI tools when searching for digital talent - especially in the search for digital talents within the company. The assumption that only larger companies with the corresponding financial resources can afford this option cannot be confirmed. The originality of the work lies in the finding that suitable AI tools exist for SMEs to search for digital talent, but that these are not currently being used extensively. Barriers such as prohibitively high costs or the low user-friendliness of AI tools could not be confirmed within the scope of this study. © 2023 Mykolo Romerio Universitetas.

The system was created as a decision support tool to assist production planners in arranging weekly production orders to work centers and other manufacturing cells. The functionality offered includes dispatching priority rules, bottleneck identification for capacity planning, production order reallocation to alternate work centers and planning periods, interchangeable scheduling scenarios, and work-in-process availability checks based on bill of materials (BOM) precedence constraints. As a consequence, a solid short-term production plan is created, capable of absorbing shop floor risks such as machine failures and urgent orders. The primary design ideas are simplicity, ease of use, a flexible Gantt-chart-based graphical user interface (GUI), controllable report creation, and a modest development budget. The practical application takes place in a make-to-stock (MTS) environment with a complicated multi-level production process, defined due dates, and parallel machines. A critical component is the integration with legacy applications and the existing enterprise resource planning (ERP) system.

Thanks to the analysis of the latest publications and in particular of the articles and reports published by academics, consulting firms and think tanks, this contribution aims to build an exploratory representation of the expected effects of the development of AI in the process of bank credit analysis. This procedural development, in comparison with the statistical approaches traditionally used, can serve as an original technical-financial support for a better inclusion of the excluded. The use of new sources of information by AI makes it possible to reveal weak signals, whether in the form of interactions or non-linearities between the explanatory variables for the assessment of customer creditworthiness. Thus, the predictive improvement of this new process of credit analysis sometimes translate, at the macroeconomic level, into positive estimates for economic growth and, at the microeconomic level, by individual gains, in particular by improving financial inclusion and access to credit for the most vulnerable borrowers. Based on this, the synthesized case study of Fintech Linddo’s experience in setting up a credit assessment for women-led SMEs in Ethiopia presented very encouraging results. However, these new bank credit analysis processes can raise many biases and especially ethical, legal and regulatory questions.

The aim is to predict future skills requirements and match them with existing interorganizational skills. Companies are required to anticipate changes in markets, industries, and technologies at an early stage as well as to identify changes in job profiles within an occupational profile by tapping into and evaluating various data sources. Based on these findings, they can then make informed decisions regarding skill gaps, for example, to implement targeted further training measures. Forecasting-based skills management offers the opportunity to optimally qualify employees for constantly changing tasks. At the same time, however, the targeted development of such skills requires a high level of time, financial and personnel resources, which small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) generally do not have at their disposal. In addition, many SMEs are not yet aware of the importance of this issue. Within the framework of research and industrial projects of the Smart Work department at the FIR (Institute for Industrial Management) at the RWTH Aachen University, an AI-based skills forecasting tool will be developed. The goal of the paper is to conceptualize the future machine learning method, that is able to generate individualized skills forecasts and recommendations for SMEs. This is achieved by linking societal forecasts and sector trends with company-specific conditions and skills. In order to generate a corresponding database, the derivation system is made available to various companies (large companies and SMEs) in order to obtain as many data sets as possible. The data sets obtained via the derivation system are then used as training data sets for the machine learning method, with the help of which an automatic derivation of competencies depending on new trends is to be made possible. © 2023, Publish-Ing in cooperation with TIB - Leibniz Information Centre for Science and Technology University Library.

The research employed the Louvain clustering algorithm to effectively group the loan recipients based on their cumulative repayment amounts over time, and two distinct machine learning techniques, namely logistic regression (LR) and k-nearest neighbour (k-NN) were harnessed to evaluate their efficacy in classifying recipients' risk levels, namely low-risk or high-risk. The LR model achieved mean accuracy score of 100% which indicates a high level of precision that can effectively predict the risk of SME loan repayment. This is further supported by the Area Under the Curve (AUC) value of 1.0 obtained by the LR model which suggests that the model has achieved optimal separation of the two classes, and therefore it is highly reliable for risk prediction. This technique is believed to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of credit risk assessment that could enable financial institutions (FIs) to optimize their decision-making processes and mitigate potential losses caused by the defaulting loans.

In emerging economies, the business sector, especially Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), has a number of obstacles, including a lack of resources, financial support, and professional skills. Furthermore, SMEs depend on international resources to compete in an unpredictable industry in the long term. A structured questionnaire survey was undertaken to collect data from 380 Pakistani SMEs in order to preserve the productive insights. For data processing, a hybrid partial least square structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) technique was used. The findings show that financial resources have a favorable and substantial influence on SMEs' long-term performance, but technical resources have no meaningful impact on SMEs' long-term performance. Furthermore, green entrepreneurial approach somewhat mediators the association between financial resources and long-term success while totally mediating the link between technical resources and long-term performance. Finally, we run a sensitivity analysis to confirm our results. The ANN design explains 71% of the suggested model's accuracy.

While the mobility sector is moving more toward EV’s, the electricity demand and volatility increase. Ideally, for those who can individualise parts of their electricity consumption, electricity should be consumed when there is low consumption and high production of renewable energy to reduce emissions and volatility. To optimise usage, a prediction of future energy consumption would be useful. Within the EFRE-financed research project ‘AI Factory SME’ the goal is to create a platform for dynamic electricity pricing based on predicting energy consumption and PV production from industry partners. This way, the natural fluctuations in the production of electricity from renewable energy sources are considered through a flexible payment model. Within this paper, the advantages of a renewables market place with dynamic pricing as a business model are described.

However, advanced technology may harm employee attitudes. The adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) and robots may replace workers. Hence, many workers are worried about employment security. Few studies quantitatively demonstrated these negative aspects of technology. Therefore, we clarified the influence of technology on job satisfaction and turnover intention of employees. Structural equation modeling was applied to an online survey of 571 full-time employees of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in Japan. The results showed that the introduction of basic technology had a positive effect on job satisfaction and the introduction of advanced technology had a positive effect on turnover intention, while removal of old technology had no significant effect. Accordingly, managers must not underestimate the basic technical environment but implement it quickly. In addition, when introducing cutting-edge technology, managers must give due consideration to employee concerns about employment security. If the purpose and scope of impact are not carefully explained to employees before the technology is introduced, employee turnover increases.

Therefore, this paper structures the practical experience of state support of European countries in the digitalization of SMEs. The study conducts a cluster analysis to identify countries whose experience in state support for business digitalization is the best for adoption. Clustering employed the criterion of using key digitization instruments: internet of things, integration of business processes into electronic processes, digital integration with customers/suppliers, cloud services, big data analysis, and artificial intelligence. Thus, 4 clusters were identified (the first cluster comprises 16 countries, the second - 2, the third - 5, and the fourth - 7). These findings contributed to the selection of some key measures. They included: expanding the financial capabilities of SMEs to adopt digital technologies in their processes; formation of digital hard skills among entrepreneurs and increasing the personnel potential of SME digitization; creation of a favorable business environment to stimulate the digital activity of SMEs; and popularization of business digitalization strategy as a component of digital transformation strategy in society. © Viktoriia Strilets, Serhiy Frolov, Viktoriia Datsenko, Oksana Tymoshenko, Maksym Yatsko, 2022.",,10.21511/ppm.20(4).2022.22,artificial intelligence;digital transformation;small and medium enterprises;state support,,,True,True,False,False

The transition state diagram of the individual and simultaneous production system has been developed with the application of the Markov decision model approach. It was used to analyze the present variables of the production systems and forecast the optimal maintenance parameters such as the failure rate and the repair rate, through the production system's availability analysis. This availability analysis reveals that system B (Piercing) is classified as the most critical because of the abrupt availability variation compared to all other production systems, concerning the corresponding maintenance parameters such as a failure rate of 0.0371, a repair rate of 0.7094, and the availability of the piercing system of 0.5056. Finally, the use of an autonomous PM management system and the most effective maintenance workforce has enhanced productivity and customer satisfaction in SMEs.

This research aims to identify the key dimensions of AI-driven digital transformation (AIDT) and develop a grounded theory that provides a rich and nuanced understanding of how the AIDT process unfolds within Canadian SMEs. The study reveals that the AIDT process is shaped by the interplay of five core dimensions: evaluating transformation context, auditing organisational readiness, piloting the AI integration, scaling the implementation, and leading the transformation. The first four dimensions follow a sequential, stage-like progression, while the fifth dimension is recurring and omnipresent, exerting a continuous impact on the other phases. AIDT is characterised as a path-dependent, slow evolutionary change spectrum that demands firms adapt by developing their sensing, seizing and reconfiguration capacities to evolve and sustain their evolutionary fitness.

To communicate and engage customers effectively, organisations like SMEs need to adopt novel technology. Artificial intelligence, though not new, has brought about the emergence of chatbots, which big organisations have largely adopted. However, literature has shown that SMEs are lagging in the adoption of chatbots as most previous studies were also conducted among large organisations. Hence, this study proposes a conceptual framework based on an integrated Technology-Organisation-Environment Model to predict the adoption of chatbots among SMEs. The proposed framework consists of the technology acceptance model core variables, perceived technology security, perceived organisational resources, pressure from customers and competitors, small and medium enterprise organisational culture, and anthropomorphism. Though previous studies have used this framework to predict the adoption of technology, the novelty of this study is its usage among SMEs to adopt chatbots and the moderating roles of organisational culture and anthropomorphism.

Whereas Industry 4.0 is still focused primarily on economic objectives to be achieved through digital transformation and automation of monotonous work processes, Industry 5.0 will also bring in social and ecological objectives. The focus is on holistic, sustainable, and human-centered value creation. Thus, the complexity of digitalization is increasing with the implementation of direct collaboration between humans and machines. In particular, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are faced with major challenges as they have limited resources for implementing a successful digitalization strategy. This makes the use of maturity models (MMs) a valuable tool for shaping the strategically aligned digitalization transition of companies. In this context, this paper reviews whether the currently existing MMs for Industry 4.0 address the specific requirements of Industry 5.0, and sufficiently consider a human-centered approach along with the assessment of readiness for disruptive technologies in companies (especially SMEs). The study examines currently existing Industry 4.0 MMs as a part of a systematic literature review. A total of 297 German- and English-language publications were found and systematically investigated, of which 24 MMs provided sufficient scientific information in the end. These were categorized using a self-developed evaluation matrix. Furthermore, they were evaluated and discussed regarding their human-centered approach and applicability to SMEs.

The core task of a Smart factory is to establish an integrated data hub to process storage, management, and analysis in real-time, and to manage cluster processes, energy, environment, and safety in an integrated manner. Smart factory efficiency is important to improve reliability through accurate analysis and collection of production data by real-time monitoring of production site management for SMEs. In particular, as various advanced equipment related to artificial intelligence is included in the configuration of the Smart factory, the efficiency of data collection and utilization produced at the manufacturing site is gradually increasing. In this paper, we analyze the enterprise application cases of SCM, MES, and CPS, which are smart factory technologies applied to the manufacturing sites of SMEs based on electricity and electronics. By analyzing the platform technology competitiveness, which is the key to the introduction of the smart factory, it is intended to enhance the efficiency of applying and operating the smart factory for SMEs. © 2022, Success Culture Press.

The stated goal of the XS2A rule is to help an infant industry grow: that of Fintech payment services. However, mounting evidence suggests that unlike Fintech startups, big techs may benefit from the norm, putting a much stronger challenge to established banks. The latter indeed have less access to data about consumers’ behavior (preferences, habits and conducts), less analytics capacity, and thus are placed in a competitive disadvantage by the XS2A, compared to their big tech rivals. According to many, that may result in competition harm and consumer welfare reduction in the medium and long run. The article revisits the rationales for introducing the XS2A rule by critically assessing its asserted goals (Part 1). It then suggests (Part 2) that to level the playing field among the market players involved and increase its overall proportionality, the norm be revisited. In the relationship between big tech and the banks, we propose to complement the XS2A rule with a “reciprocity clause”. Instead of free access to customers’ account data, big tech would pay by counter-providing access to the behavioral data in their possession pertaining to the same customers concerned by the XS2A, and upon their consent. Data thus transmitted would only be available upon condition of reuse to increase the efficiency of the payment service provision. Reciprocity would greatly enhance data circulation among market participants, while fostering competition among them, creating incentives for more innovation and strengthening the overall proportionality of the XS2A rule. © 2020, Max Planck Institute for Innovation and Competition, Munich.",,10.1007/s40319-020-00914-1,Access to account;Algorithms;Artificial intelligence;Banks;Big data;Big tech;Competition;Database;Digital conglomerates;Financial markets;Fintech;Platforms;Privacy;Regulation;SMEs;XS2A,,,False,False,False,True

Recent years, financial risk analysis for SMEs attracts lots of attentions from financial institutions. However, the financial risk analysis for SMEs usually suffers data deficiency problem, especially for the online financial institutions which seldom collect credit-related data directly from SMEs. Fortunately, although credit-related information of SMEs is hard to be acquired sufficiently, the interactive relationships between SMEs, which may contain valuable information of financial risk, is usually available for the online financial institutions. Finding out credit-related relationship of SME from massive interactions helps comprehensively model the SMEs thus improve the performance of financial risk analysis. In this paper, tackling the data deficiency problem of financial risk analysis for SMEs, we propose an innovative financial risk analysis framework with graph-based supply chain mining. Specifically, to capture the credit-related topological structure and temporal variation of SMEs, we design and employ a novel spatial-temporal aware graph neural network, to mine supply chain relationship on a SME graph, and then analysis the financial risk based on the mined supply chain graph. Experimental results on real-world financial datasets prove the effectiveness of our proposal for financial risk analysis for SMEs. © 2020 Inst. Sci. inf., Univ. Defence in Belgrade.

Policy makers world-wide nowadays aim to foster environments conducive for AI-based innovation. This paper addresses the current lack of empirical data for evidence-based innovation policies and the management of AI-based innovation. It focuses on ""AI and innovation management"" in addressing the question whether innovation that is based on new AI technology requires a management approach different from other forms of IT innovation. We present results from a study of Austrian companies on the degree of use and implementation of AI, and on challenges related to AI-based innovation management. This study used a keyword-list approach to define ""Artificial Intelligence"" and to find Al-based innovation projects in research databases. These projects facilitated the identification of experts from organisations developing AI-based innovation. In total, eleven experts were interviewed about their AI-based innovation activities. The results show that AI is a very fast emerging technology that is being applied in many sectors. A broad range of innovative solutions are being developed and some have already reached the market. Specific AI business models are, however, less clear and still developing. Companies are facing multiple challenges from regulation to human resources and data collection. Managing AI-based innovation will be particularly difficult for smaller enterprises, where problems are often more pronounced than in larger industries. Explicit challenges for managing AI-based innovations include the necessary attention to managing expectations and ensuring historic metadata expertise essential for many AI-based solutions. Policies to support AI-based innovation therefore should focus on human aspects. This includes increasing the availability of AI experts, but also concerns the development of new job profiles, such as experts in AI training. AI innovators also require clear AI regulation and research investments in key challenges, such as explainable AI. © 2019 Carleton University.

This can be achieved by transformation into the digital economy, use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques, integrating business processes and to have real-time information which will enable senior management to make better, quicker informed decisions. Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) is one of the solutions for the SMEs to overcome these challenges and to obtain a competitive advantage. Subanidja, and Broto, 2019 stated that ERP systems are still not widely implemented by SMEs compared to their introduction in large businesses. However, the SME have a justifiable reputation for being proactive, open, willing and receptive to the adoption of new technologies, concepts and improvements. Also, SMEs differ in several inherent characteristics which are likely to impact on the ERP system implementations, hence it does not make sense to use the same frameworks that have been developed for large companies to implement ERP system within SMEs. One of the main risks of adopting ERP in SMEs is that SMEs have limited resources, so they cannot afford to fail to implement ERP system. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to explore ERP implementation process in SME context. The developed framework has been used to implement an ERP system in a SME. It highlighted the issues that need to be addressed while implementing ERP system in SMEs such as clearly defined scope of implementation procedure, suitable project planning and minimal customisation of the system selected for implementation.

SMES accomplishes this by recording the player input, displaying it in a visual form, allowing the player to edit the recorded playtrace, and replay the edited sequence back again. Our system combines ideas from tool-assisted speedruns (TAS) with interaction design patterns from Casual Creators and Accessible Player Experiences. Because our implementation is based on intercepting input events at the operating system level, no engineering effort is needed to apply the tool to new games. The result is a new mode of play for existing games that further allows players to realize new behaviors in the game. SMES could support making games more inclusive by letting players adapt the challenge type they face.

Recent literature has provided insight about large firms gaining benefits from Industry 4.0, but many of these benefits do not translate to SMEs. The agent-oriented smart factory (AOSF) framework provides a solution to help bridge the gap between Industry 4.0 frameworks and SME-oriented setups by providing a general and high-level supply chain (SC) framework and an associated agent-oriented storage and retrieval (AOSR)-based warehouse management strategy. This paper presents the extended heuristics of the AOSR algorithm and details how it improves the performance efficiency in an SME-oriented warehouse.

Therefore, this study empirically examines antecedents to, and consequences of, successful acceptance of AI practices by B2B SMEs in Saudi Arabia. A conceptual model based on the technology-organisation-environment framework is developed which considers the impact of AI enablers and AI readiness on the acceptance of AI practices, and the impact of this on relational governance, performance, and SMEs' AI-based business customer interaction. The conceptual model was tested using structural equation modelling of survey data collected from B2B SMEs (n = 392). The results showed that, of the AI enablers, acceptance of AI practices was significantly influenced by both technology roadmapping and attitude but not professional expertise. Of the AI readiness variables, acceptance of AI practices was significantly influenced by infrastructure and awareness but not technicality. The acceptance of AI practices was found to significantly affect AI-enabled relational governance and performance, and SME's business customer AI-based interaction.

This study proposes an extrapolative collaborative filtering (ECF) system that does not directly share data among SMEs but improves recommendation performance for small and medium‐sized companies that lack data through the extrapolation of data, which can provide a magical experience to users. Previously, recommendations were made utilizing only data generated by the merchant itself, so it was impossible to recommend goods to new users. However, our ECF system provides appropriate recommendations to new users as well as existing users based on privacypreserved payment transaction data. To accomplish this, PP2Vec using Word2Vec was developed by utilizing purchase information only, excluding personal information from payment company data. We then compared the performances of single‐merchant models and multi‐merchant models. For the merchants with more data than SMEs, the performance of the single‐merchant model was higher, while for the SME merchants with fewer data, the multi‐merchant model’s performance was higher. The ECF System proposed in this study is more suitable for the real‐world business environment because it does not directly share data among companies. Our study shows that AI (artificial intelligence) technology can contribute to the sustainability and viability of economic systems by providing high‐performance recommendation capability, especially for small and medium‐sized enterprises and start‐ups. © 2021 by the authors.

The gathered data were analysed and processed in NVivo 12 software. Results Two groups of categories (nodes) were obtained, within which related subcategories (subnodes) were located. These two groups are existing and emerging categories, which reflect the aspects that motivate, benefit and obstruct the adoption of 4.0 emerging technologies. Conclusions The identification of an emerging variable in the study of inhibitors and facilitators of the adoption and implementation of 4.0 technologies is a valuable contribution because it allows us to account for the problematisation of financing as an important variable in the processes of introduction into Industry 4.0 for SMEs.

In the international context, Germany is not considered a pioneer in the field of AI, and the implementation of AI technologies in German companies is also rather slow. Since the German economy is mainly driven by SMEs, the implementation of AI in SMEs is a key success factor of the national economy. It is known from general studies on digitalization that German SMEs are rather skeptical about new technologies. This paper discusses the implementation prospects of AI in German SMEs based on an empirical survey conducted in 2020 among 283 companies. It shows that the SMEs surveyed tend to use more traditional technologies such as rule-based systems and see the lack of employee qualifications in particular as an implementation hurdle. © 2021 The Authors.

Another important driver is digitalization and the associated increase in the volume of data. These data, from a multitude of devices and systems, offer enormous potential, which increases the need for intelligent, dynamic analysis models even in smaller companies. This article presents the results of an investigation into whether and to what extent machine learning processes can contribute to optimizing energy consumption and reducing incorrectly produced plastic parts in plastic processing SMEs. For this purpose, the machine data were recorded in a plastics-producing company for the automotive industry and analyzed with regard to the material and energy flows. Machine learning methods were used to train these data in order to uncover optimization potential. Another problem that was addressed in the project was the analysis of manufacturing processes characterized by strong non-linearities and time-invariant behavior with Big Data methods and self-learning controls. Machine learning is suitable for this if sufficient training data are available. Due to the high material throughput in the production of the SMEs’ plastic parts, these requirements for the development of suitable learning methods were met. In response to the increasing importance of current information technologies in industrial production processes, the project aimed to use these technologies for sustainable digitalization in order to reduce the industry’s environmental impact and increase efficiency. © 2021 by the authors.

Wide opportunities for AI are seen in tasks associated with credit scoring. However, the expected potential and benefits of AI-based credit scoring and the overall path to digitalised lending could be challenged by the fact that a relatively large number of SMEs in Europe are credit invisible due to their financing patterns, that limit the availability of credit history and other creditworthiness sensitive data needed to build and train AI models. The research aims to estimate the nature and availability of credit scoring relevant SMEs data in different European countries. Research methods respective to the above-stated aim are the following: scientific literature review, descriptive, and country to country comparative analysis of the data from the Survey on the Access to Finance of Enterprises (SAFE). The survey data indicate that the share of credit invisible SMEs changes in the range of 1030%, but there is no direct relationship with the characteristics of the country. The initiatives to score the creditworthiness of SMEs should consider the share of SMEs that do not use services of the traditional financing sector, which means that data about its creditworthiness are limited. The whole population of SMEs could be covered by AI models incorporating both conventional financial data from credit visible SMEs processed by machine learning as well as unstructured non-financial data (describing credit invisible SMEs) processed by deep learning techniques and methods. Thus, we claim that despite the huge potential of AI incorporation into creditworthiness evaluation, the use of AI is not a magic pill, enhancing easier SME's access to finance, unless its use is aligned to the available data. Accordingly to the accessible data, different AI tools and techniques should be applied in credit scoring applications.  © 2021 IEEE.",,10.1109/ICTE51655.2021.9584833,artificial intelligence;creditworthiness;digital lending;SMEs credit scoring;Deep learning;Population statistics;Surveys;Credit scoring;Creditworthiness;Digital lending;European Countries;Financial data;Financial industry;Integral part;Intelligence models;Sensitive datas;SME credit scoring;Finance,,,True,True,False,False

SMEs in these developed countries have created their own cyber regimes around AI and ML. This knowledge is tested daily in how these countries’ SMEs run their businesses and identify threats and attacks, based on the support structure of the individual country. Based on recent changes to the UK General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Brexit, and ISO standards requirements, machine learning cybersecurity (MLCS) adoption in the UK SME market has become prevalent and a good example to lean on, amongst other developed nations. Whilst MLCS has been successfully applied in many applications, including network intrusion detection systems (NIDs) worldwide, there is still a gap in the rate of adoption of MLCS techniques for UK SMEs. Other developed countries such as Spain and Australia also fall into this category, and similarities and differences to MLCS adoptions are discussed. Applications of how MLCS is applied within these SME industries are also explored. The paper investigates, using quantitative and qualitative methods, the challenges to adopting MLCS in the SME ecosystem, and how operations are managed to promote business growth. Much like security guards and policing in the real world, the virtual world is now calling on MLCS techniques to be embedded like secret service covert operations to protect data being distributed by the millions into cyberspace. This paper will use existing global research from multiple disciplines to identify gaps and opportunities for UK SME small business cyber security. This paper will also highlight barriers and reasons for low adoption rates of MLCS in SMEs and compare success stories of larger companies implementing MLCS. The methodology uses structured quantitative and qualitative survey questionnaires, distributed across an extensive participation pool directed to the SMEs’ management and technical and non-technical professionals using stratify methods. Based on the analysis and findings, this study reveals that from the primary data obtained, SMEs have the appropriate cybersecurity packages in place but are not fully aware of their potential. Secondary data collection was run in parallel to better understand how these barriers and challenges emerged, and why the rate of adoption of MLCS was very low. The paper draws the conclusion that help through government policies and processes coupled together with collaboration could minimize cyber threats in combatting hackers and malicious actors in trying to stay ahead of the game. These aspirations can be reached by ensuring that those involved have been well trained and understand the importance of communication when applying appropriate safety processes and procedures. This paper also highlights important funding gaps that could help raise cyber security awareness in the form of grants, subsidies, and financial assistance through various public sector policies and training. Lastly, SMEs’ lack of understanding of risks and impacts of cybercrime could lead to conflicting messages between cross-company IT and cybersecurity rules. Trying to find the right balance between this risk and impact, versus productivity impact and costs, could lead to UK SMES getting over these hurdles in this cyberspace in the quest for promoting the usage of MLCS. UK and Wales governments can use the research conducted in this paper to inform and adapt their policies to help UK SMEs become more secure from cyber-attacks and compare them to other developed countries also on the same future path. © 2021 by the authors.

Lack of strategic investment decision by SMEs could lead to further risks and vulnerabilities. The significant increase of cybersecurity threats might become a very difficult task for both SMEs and other parties in the future. The purpose of this paper is to identify potential barriers to cybersecurity risk management investment in SMEs based on conducting several interviews with decision-makers in the sector to understand the causes of this prevention. The authors aim to reveal the role the SMEs' decision-makers are playing in addressing cybersecurity risks in recent years and to suggest avenues for further research. The paper follows a qualitative exploratory approach to identify those potential barriers. Starting with an invitation are distributed by e-mail, phone call, or social medial account, to hundreds of Saudi's decision-makers in the SMEs sector, asking them to participate in this study. As a result, 20 participants from various SMEs business sectors have agreed to participate. Therefore, six potential barriers that play a key role in the prevention of cybersecurity risk management investment in SMEs, which are the financial capacity, the lack of awareness, the size of SMEs, the traditional commerce, the absence of risk standards, and the over-confidence of decision-makers. Some of these barriers impacts have been discussed before in different contexts. Yet, this study investigates these barriers impact on preventing SMEs from investing in CRM. Also, to the best of authors knowledge, none of previous research has combined these barriers together with an insight to measure their effect on managerial decision-making.

SMEs have played an essential role in transforming the American economy. SMEs forms 99 percent of all firms in the country, employ more than 50 percent of private sector employees, and account for more than 50% of the country's nonfarm GDP (Brief, 2000). Despite its role in the economy, SMEs are facing challenges in using vast chunks of data available to build a competitive environment that is significant for economic growth (Blackburn, 2016). Much of the data produced can either have a direct or indirect effect on the sector if well processed. Some of the data produced can be used to make relevant policies and decisions regarding supply chain, customer management, and market changes. To make good use of these enormous volumes of data, firms have employed available big data analytics. Although data mining has been in existence for a while now, it is until recently that big data has found its application in business. This paper intends to outline the adoption rates of big data in SMEs in the US. However, concepts of Business Intelligence (BI) was later developed to emphasize the need for the collection, analysis, and interpretation of that data for business use. With the use of BI, much of the produced data have been analyzed to help businesses make data-driven decisions which have helped them understand market trends. SMEs have for a long time used data for recording and monitoring transactions. However, in the recent past, a new awareness of the importance of data analytics have been going around.

Eventually, if the improvement actions aren't properly planned, structured or supported by the whole organization then, they end up failing in their implementation. Besides this problem, the literature on LM does not provide enough information about how the selection of Lean tools or practices should be conducted. Therefore, this study presents a decision support system that can help organizations to identify waste and to select the most appropriate tools or Lean practices to implement. It should be noted that, before any implementation of a Lean tool or practice, the organization should take care of knowing its stakeholders, define its system, be informed of the current state of the organization, and identify all the processes that add value to the organization.

Thus, AI is no longer a matter for the global Tech Companies only, but also concerns any small and medium-sized enterprise (SME). This paper examines the degree of dispersion of AI in SMEs in north-western Germany and reveals barriers and concerns when it comes to the deployment of industrial AI applications. Therefore, selected SMEs were surveyed in a standardised online survey. Currently, AI is rarely used by SMEs in north-western Germany. Few SMEs are concerned with developing their own applications, because this process is very expensive, lengthy and often comes with a high risk of failure. Rather, SMEs increasingly rely on AI-as-a-service and prefer to use cloud-based solutions. There are various reasons that make companies hesitate.

Artificial intelligence research is rising, focusing on automated emotion detection. The capability to identify the emotion, which is considered one of the traits of emotional intelligence, is a component of human intelligence. Although the study is limited dependent on facial expressions or voice is flourishing, it is identifying emotions via body movements, a less researched issue. To attain emotional intelligence, this study suggests a deep learning approach. Here initially the video can be converted into image frames after the converted image frames can be preprocessed using the Glitter bandpass butter worth filter and contrast stretch histogram equalization. Then from the enhanced image, the features can be clustered using the hybrid Gaussian BIRCH algorithm. Then the specialized features are retrieved from the body of human gestures using the AdaDelta bacteria foraging optimization algorithm, and the selected features are fed to a supervised Kernel Boosting LENET deep-learning algorithm. The experiment is conducted using Geneva multimodal emotion portrayals (GEMEPs) corpus data set. This data set includes, human body gestures portraying the archetypes of five emotions, such as anger, fear, joy, pride, and sad. In these emotion detection techniques, the suggested Kernel Boosting LENET classifier achieves 98.5% accuracy, 94% precision, 95% sensitivity, and F-Score 93% outperformed better than the other existing classifiers. As a result, emotional acknowledgment may help small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to improve their performance and entrepreneurial orientation.

Manufacturing companies are pursuing breakthroughs by introducing various advanced technologies to ensure their competitiveness. However, it is difficult for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to adopt smart-factory technologies, owing to financial and technical burdens. This paper proposes a smart factory that can be applied technically and strategically to the introduction of a smart factory for SMEs. The concept of an ‘appropriate smart factory’ involves applying appropriate measures in terms of cost and scale with consideration of the situations faced by SMEs. The goal is to build a smart factory that has necessary functions (Essential) but can be easily operated (Simple) at a low cost (Affordable) and has compatibility (Interoperable). This paper presents technical application measures such as appropriate smart sensors, appropriate IoT (Internet of Things), and small data processing, along with the definition of an appropriate smart factory. In addition, a case study was examined where the quality inspection equipment for garment manufacturing SMEs was developed by applying the appropriate smart factory concept. © 2020, The Author(s).",,10.1007/s12541-020-00445-2,Appropriate smart factory;Artificial intelligence;Edge computing;Internet of Things;Interoperable;Sensor;Small and medium-sized enterprises;Data handling;Internet of things;Manufacture;Advanced technology;Garment manufacturing;Industrial revolutions;Manufacturing companies;Manufacturing industries;Quality inspection;Small and medium-sized enterprise;Technical applications;Garment industry,,,True,True,False,False

With an increase in more wired and wireless connections and devices on SME networks, unpredictable malicious activities and interruptions have risen. Finding the harmony between the advancement of technology and costs has always been a balancing act particularly in convincing the finance directors of these SMEs to invest in capital towards their IT infrastructure. This paper looks at various devices that currently are in the market to detect intrusions and look at how these devices handle prevention strategies for SMEs in their working environment both at home and in the office, in terms of their credibility in handling zero-day attacks against the costs of achieving so. The experiment was set up during the 2020 pandemic referred to as COVID-19 when the world experienced an unprecedented event of large scale. The operational working environment of SMEs reflected the context when the UK went into lockdown. Pre-pandemic would have seen this experiment take full control within an operational office environment; however, COVID-19 times has pushed us into a corner to evaluate every aspect of cybersecurity from the office and keeping the data safe within the home environment. The devices chosen for this experiment were OpenSource such as SNORT and pfSense to detect activities within the home environment, and Cisco, a commercial device, set up within an SME network. All three devices operated in a live environment within the SME network structure with employees being both at home and in the office. All three devices were observed from the rules they displayed, their costs and machine learning techniques integrated within them. The results revealed these aspects to be important in how they identified zero-day attacks. The findings showed that OpenSource devices whilst free to download, required a high level of expertise in personnel to implement and embed machine learning rules into the business solution even for staff working from home. However, when using Cisco, the price reflected the buy-in into this expertise and Cisco’s mainframe network, to give up-to-date information on cyber-attacks. The requirements of the UK General Data Protection Regulations Act (GDPR) were also acknowledged as part of the broader framework of the study. Machine learning techniques such as anomaly-based intrusions did show better detection through a commercially subscription-based model for support from Cisco compared to that of the OpenSource model which required internal expertise in machine learning. A cost model was used to compare the outcome of SMEs’ decision making, in getting the right framework in place in securing their data. In conclusion, finding a balance between IT expertise and costs of products that are able to help SMEs protect and secure their data will benefit the SMEs from using a more intelligent controlled environment with applied machine learning techniques, and not compromising on costs. © 2021 by the authors.",,10.3390/fi13080186,Artificial intelligence;Cyber threat;Cybersecurity;Detection;Intrusion;Intrusion detection;Machine learning;Network intrusion;OpenSource;Prevention;Balancing;Decision making;Investments;Network security;Personnel;Privacy by design;Applied machine learning;Controlled environment;General data protection regulations;Machine learning techniques;Malicious activities;Prevention strategies;Small and medium enterprise;Small medium enterprise;Machine learning,,,True,True,False,False

In order for AI to have any success but also for it to become transparent, explainable and auditable where needed, we need to make sure the data regulation and data governance around it is of the highest quality standards in relation to the application domain. One of the challenges is that AI regulation might - and needs to - rely heavily on data regulation, yet data regulation is highly complex. This is both a strategic problem for Europe and a practical problematic: people, institutions, governments and companies might increasingly need and want data for AI, and both will affect each other technically, socially but also regulatory. At the moment, there is an enormous disconnect between regulating AI, because this happens mainly through ethical frameworks, and concrete data regulation. The role of data regulation seems to be largely ignored in the AI ethics debate, Article 22 GDPR being perhaps the only exception.

This is due to the various benefits it provides, such as pay-as-you-go service model, flexibility of services, and on-demand accessibility. The proliferation of cloud services leads to their wide spread use and calls for comprehensive evaluation approaches in order to be able to choose the most suitable alternatives. To this end, existing studies in the literature generally provide solutions incorporating a single method for making such decisions. Therefore, this study proposes a more comprehensive solution in the form of a decision support system named as ClouDSS which employs various Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) methods with the aim of optimizing cloud service selection decisions. ClouDSS has a default decision model, which can be customized according to enterprise-specific requirements, for evaluating the suitability of cloud services with respect to business needs. After presenting the main components of ClouDSS, the employed cloud service selection process is described in order to highlight the associated tasks, including both objective and subjective evaluation approaches.

The stated funding alternatives determine the levels (high, moderate, or low) of service productivity of the SMEs. The product demand rate is also critical for the effective determination of the sustainable level of productivity. The new system has solved the problem of funding in the industry by relaxing the rigid traditional productivity system with inclusion of alternative levels of funding. The results of the study showed that the new system was robust and flexible in evaluating the productivity performance indices of the enterprises at different funding and demand probabilities. Results generally showed low productivities (less than 0.4) in most of test cases, but they were adequate to cater for the levels of demands in the enterprises.

This problem is solved here by applying BIA to tune the parameters of MPC with SMES and CES units simultaneously to minimize the deviations of frequency and tie line powers against load perturbations. Simulation results are carried out to emphasize the superiority of the proposed coordinated design as compared with conventional proportional-integral controller and with BIA-based MPC without SMES and CES units.

Nowhere is this more relevant than for resource-constrained small to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that cannot afford the costs associated with failed ERP implementations. Based on this background, a critical document review and analysis of literature on ERP system selection factors were performed. These results were then compared to the findings from a qualitative case study conducted on a South African SME in the process of selecting an ERP system.

Furthermore, the stability issue is of crucial importance in relation to training algorithms adjusting the parameters of neural networks. If the predictor is unstable for certain choices of neural model parameters, serious numerical problems can occur during training. Stability criteria should be universal, applicable to as broad a class of systems as possible and at the same time computationally efficient. The majority of well-known approaches are based on Lyapunov's method [163, 77, 164, 165, 166, 167]. Fang and Kincaid applied the matrix measure technique to study global exponential stability of asymmetrical Hopfield type networks [168]. Jin et. al [169] derived sufficient conditions for absolute stability of a general class of discrete-time recurrent networks by using Ostrowski's theorem. Recently, global asymptotic as well exponential stability conditions for discrete-time recurrent networks with globally Lipschitz continuous and monotone nondecreasing activation functions were introduced by Hu and Wang [170]. The existence and uniqueness of an equilibrium were given as a matrix determinant problem. Unfortunately, most of the existing results do not consider the stabilization of the network during training. They allow checking the stability of the neural model only after training it. Literature about the stabilization of neural network during training is rather scarce. Jin and Gupta proposed two training methods for a discrete-time dynamic network: multiplier and constrained learning rate algorithms. Both algorithms utilized stability conditions derived by using Lyapunov's first method and Gersgorin's theorem. In turn, Suykens et al. [172] derived stability conditions for recurrent multi-layer network using linearisation, robustness analysis of linear systems under non-linear perturbations and matrix inequalities. The elaborated conditions have been used to constrain the dynamic backpropagation algorithm. These solutions, however, are devoted to globally recurrent networks. © 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",,10.1007/978-3-540-79872-9_5,"Algorithms;Aluminum;Artificial intelligence;Asymptotic stability;Backpropagation;Backpropagation algorithms;Computer networks;Continuous time systems;Control system stability;Control theory;Dynamical systems;Dynamics;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Electric fault currents;Evolutionary algorithms;Function evaluation;Identification (control systems);Learning algorithms;Linear matrix inequalities;Linear stability analysis;Linear systems;Mathematical models;Matrix algebra;Mechanics;Metropolitan area networks;Model checking;Network protocols;Neural networks;Numerical methods;Parameter estimation;Robust control;Stabilization;System stability;Telecommunication networks;Vegetation;(e ,2e) theory;(I ,J) conditions;(Liquid + liquid) equilibrium;(SIM+SME) training method;absolute stability;Applied (CO);Artificial neural network (ANNs);Computationally efficient;Discrete time (DT);Dynamic back propagation;Existence and uniqueness;Exponential stability;Fault diagnosis (FD);General class;Global exponential stability (GES);Globally Lipschitz;Heidelberg (CO);Hopfield;Learning rates;Lyapunov;Matrix determinant;Matrix inequalities;Matrix measures;Monotone nondecreasing activation functions;Multi layer networks;Neural modeling;Non-linear;Numerical problems;Recurrent networks;Robustness analysis;Springer (CO);stability conditions;Sufficient conditions (SC);System identification (SI);Technical processing;Training algorithms;Stability criteria",,,False,False,True,False

The paper presents a novel application of BCA for robot pick-and-place operation. To enable robust manipulation by a six axis industrial robot manipulator, it is important that the correct orientation of the parts is input to the manipulator. This orientation is input by a vision system which is then used to orient the robot gripper to correctly handle the part. BCA is used for the purpose of robust template matching by the vision system. The BCA algorithm is inspired by the collective behavior of honey bees to find food sources around the hive, which is one of the Swarm Intelligence (SI) techniques.

Most of the organizations around the world use ERP or Lean, but rarely both. Literature reveals that modern operations management, by default, requires all industries to use an ERP system. Increasing competition compels industries to reduce their costs and improve operational efficiency, which may be possible by practicing lean manufacturing principles. Small and medium enterprises are not familiar where ERP system is required and where the lean approach is suitable when they have a specific business objective. Therefore, the article presents the relative contribution of ERP and Lean system to facilitate in the realization of business objectives in manufacturing. Contribution/importance levels are ranked as 'importance weight', which will guide the small and medium enterprises in strategically distributing their resources on either ERP, Lean or both.

The purpose of this paper is to identify and trade off the critical supply chain measures which are interrelated and in contradiction with each other. Design/methodology/approach - The GLE was developed as an extension of the supply chain performance assessment tool proposed by Banomyong and Supatn (2011). It contained nine measures covering key activities along the supply chain under dimensions of cost, time and reliability. Their interrelations were figured out by causal linkages, whereas their contradictions were traded off as multi-objective optimization. It is solved using fuzzy goal programming along with a weighted max-min operator in order to acquire the Pareto-optimal solution. Findings - The results from the GLE showed there were two critical supply chain measures including supply chain cost per sales and average order cycle time. They contradictorily influenced by a root-cause, namely product lot size. Its Pareto-optimal value was provided to achieve the minimized values of supply chain cost per sales and average order cycle time which were consistent with their relative weights. Research limitations/implications - As generic features, the GLE needs further validation in several industries under various supply chain strategies. The further validation may contribute the GLE to include multiple decision variables, multiple types of product and multiple periods of time. In addition, the GLE may consider a dimensional measure of environmental impact along the supply chain activities. Originality/value - The GLE is a unique decision support system to identify and trade off the critical, interrelated and contradicting supply chain measures. More uniqueness is obtained when the GLE offers an option of inputting a set of relative weights for the interrelated supply chain measures.",,10.1108/JMTM-02-2017-0029,Optimization;Small-And medium-sized enterprises;Supply chain management;Artificial intelligence;Computer programming;Costs;Decision making;Economic and social effects;Environmental impact;Linear programming;Multiobjective optimization;Optimal systems;Optimization;Pareto principle;Supply chain management;Design/methodology/approach;Development stages;Fuzzy goal programming;Pareto optimal solutions;Small and medium sized enterprise;Supply chain costs;Supply chain performance;Supply chain strategy;Decision support systems,,,False,False,False,False

The selection involves trading-off multiple cardinal and ordinal criteria in an optimal fashion. Such a decision is multi-criteria in nature. ""Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution"" (TOPSIS) is a distance-based multi-criteria decisionmaking tool that considers both ideal and negative-ideal solutions within its feasible solution domain. In reality, ideal solution is not attainable. Therefore, TOPSIS considers the shortest Euclidean distance from the ideal solution to have a composite of the best performance values exhibited by a candidate-alternative for each of the criteria. However, TOPSIS does not have provision to allow cross-functional planning criteria evolved from the multi-functional teams of SMEs. At this juncture, Quality Function Deployment (QFD), an existing cross-functional planning technique, is suitable integrated with TOPSIS for latter's better flexibility. The proposed methodology is validated using a benchmark problem from the literature. As an example, ten candidatesuppliers are ranked using the developed methodology considering eight disparate criteria and cost factors. Selection of the best candidate-supplier is made based upon a nondimensional selection-index containing the objective factor decision weight.

This study focuses on the impact of decision support system in SME's and E-Business. Information and communications technologies have considerable potential to promote development and economic growth. They can foster innovation and improve productivity. They can reduce transaction costs and make available, in mere seconds, the rich store of global knowledge. In the hands of developing countries, and especially small-and medium-sized enterprises, the use of ICTs can bring impressive gains in employment, gender equality and standards of living. Even though there are several differences and disadvantages for SMEs, there are also some advantageous aspects for them, including the possibility of adopting simpler life cycle engineering methods and avoiding organizational problems that are typical in large sized company. They should make their own suitable strategies based on understanding the relation of economical, technical, and environmental aspects.

To capture this centrality requires that a model of comparison must be able to integrate with other processes and handle the size and complexity of the representations required by the tasks being modeled. This paper describes extensions to Structure-Mapping Engine (SME) since its inception in 1986 that have increased its scope of operation. We first review the basic SME algorithm, describe psychological evidence for SME as a process model, and summarize its role in simulating similarity-based retrieval and generalization. Then we describe five techniques now incorporated into the SME that have enabled it to tackle large-scale modeling tasks: (a) Greedy merging rapidly constructs one or more best interpretations of a match in polynomial time: O(n2log(n)); (b) Incremental operation enables mappings to be extended as new information is retrieved or derived about the base or target, to model situations where information in a task is updated over time; (c) Ubiquitous predicates model the varying degrees to which items may suggest alignment; (d) Structural evaluation of analogical inferences models aspects of plausibility judgments; (e) Match filters enable large-scale task models to communicate constraints to SME to influence the mapping process. We illustrate via examples from published studies how these enable it to capture a broader range of psychological phenomena than before.

The importance of credit scoring has increased recently because of the financial crisis and increased capital requirements for banks. There are, however, only few studies that develop credit coring models for SME lending. The objective of this study is to introduce a novel, more accurate credit risk estimation approach for SMEs business lending. Based on traditional statistical methods and recent artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, we proposed a hybrid model which combines the logistic regression approach and artificial neural networks (ANN). In order to test the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed hybrid model, we use the data of Finnish SMEs from the fiscal years 2004 to 2012. Our results suggest that the proposed ANN/logistic hybrid model is more accurate than either of the initial models ANN or logistic regression. This improvement in the accuracy of the credit scoring model decreases evaluation errors and has thereby many potential practical implications. First of all, a more accurate credit scoring model can result in better performance of the whole SME loan portfolio. Second, it can also result in lower capital requirements from the banks perspective and lower interest rates from the individual firm's perspective. Combined, these effects will enhance the banks competitiveness in the market for SME loans. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Entropy has been proved to be useful to evaluate the inconsistency of uncertainty among different respondents. The study demonstrates an entropy-based financial decision support system called e-FDSS. This integrated system provides decision support to evaluate attributes (funding options and multiple risks) available in projects. Fuzzy logic theory is included in the system to deal with the qualitative aspect of these options and risks. An adaptive genetic algorithm (AGA) is also employed to solve the decision algorithm in the system in order to provide optimal and consistent rates to these attributes. Seven simplified and parallel projects from a Hong Kong construction small and medium enterprise (SME) were assessed to evaluate the system. The result shows that the system calculates risk adjusted discount rates (RADR) of projects in an objective way. These rates discount project cash flow impartially. Inconsistency of uncertainty is also successfully evaluated by the use of the entropy method. Finally, the system identifies the favourable funding options that are managed by a scheme called SME Loan Guarantee Scheme (SGS).

The system uses 3D CAD to represent a graphic model of the design, and it uses AI symbolic models of the geometric forms, intended functions and computed and assigned behaviors of the design. The system uses AI symbolic reasoning methods to analyze design behavior and compare predicted behavior with intended function. The Semantic Modeling Extension (SME) system incorporates a virtual product model: a small but extendible set of classes that define generic forms, functions and behaviors of facilities. After drawing a design using 3D CAD, a designer interactively creates interpretation objects as instances of the virtual product model. The interpretation objects express the meaning of the graphic representation with respect to a particular engineering issue, such as energy use or cost. The interpretation represents geometric and topological attributes of the features for use by automated design analysis tools. Interpretation objects unite support for graphically-oriented design thinking with support for automated symbolic reasoning. The paper includes an example building design scenario using the software prototype, illustrating how interpretation of the geometric model produces a symbolic model and supports multiple and changing analyses and evaluations during design.

Mfg./Mech. Engineering, University of South Australia, Mawson Lakes, SA 5095, Australia","Manufacturing has been identified as a key pillar of growth in many Southeast Asian (ASEAN) economies. However, in the last decade many countries have become keen competitors for foreign direct investments. Many countries are trying to improve their total business capabilities by encouraging computerisation of small and medium sized enterprises (SME). Manufacturing SMEs (M-SMEs) are tasked to adopt technologically advanced programmes. With an improving public education system and more literate work force, more SMEs are better positioned to tap into the knowledge-based economy. There is tremendous amount of knowledge intensive activities within the multi-flows of the M-SMEs. Although the concept of ERP systems and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques have been around for more than two decades, this has largely remained the domain of the larger companies. ASEAN M-SMEs have been slow to implement it. In this paper, the various strategic and operational requirements of regional M-SMEs are presented and a knowledge-based resources planning model making use of AI techniques is proposed. This improved AI model makes use of the large amount of accumulated knowledge typically found in the M-SMEs, especially those in the electronics and precision engineering sectors. This includes a case study of how an electronics precision engineering company adopted the proposed AI model.",,10.1016/S0736-5845(02)00033-9,Artificial intelligence;Enterprise resources planning;Neural networks;Production operations and management;Supply chain management;Artificial intelligence;Knowledge based systems;Neural networks;Precision engineering;Supply chain management;Enterprise resource planning,,,True,True,False,False

The system is fully implemented and operational, and has been successfully put to use on data from actual SMEs. Although the system is packed with knowledge and expertise, it was not implemented with ""traditional"" symbolic AI techniques. We explain why and discuss how the system relates to expert systems, decision support systems, and AI. We also report on an experimental evaluation and identify ongoing and future developments.",,10.1007/978-3-540-24677-0_83,Artificial intelligence;Benchmarking;Data acquisition;Decision support systems;Genetic algorithms;Information retrieval;Mathematical models;Problem solving;Strategic planning;Expert systems;Diagnostic-recommendation systems;Information systems (IS);Medium-sized enterprises (SME);Real-life applications;AI techniques;Experimental evaluation;Hybrid diagnostic;Expert systems;Recommender systems,,,True,True,False,False

Second, there are situations where the system cannot capture information at the level of precision the user wishes to provide. We describe the techniques that have been developed for CYC to address these two cases during the extension of a variety of domains. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2004.",,10.1007/978-3-540-30545-3_15,Client server computer systems;Database systems;Expert systems;Knowledge based systems;Natural language processing systems;Query languages;Semantics;Societies and institutions;Artificial intelligence;Computers;Ontology;Reformulators;Subject matter experts (SME);Text sources;Knowledge gaps;Knowledge acquisition;Knowledge management,,,False,False,True,False

By hypothesis we limit our approach to competence increase for individual firms within a network, and we don't cover the increase of collective competence of the network itself We develop a framework of decision support system, which objective is to compare alternative plans of actions for the collaborative development of competencies. We use a multi-criteria decisional method, and we formalize the decision process based on five criteria including the evaluation of value creation, cost generation and equity between partners. We apply the approach to an industrial case study of SMEs, in the field of software development. © 2005 by International Federation for Information Processing.",,,Artificial intelligence;Decision support systems;Industrial applications;Collaborative development;Collaborative relationships;Decision process;Evaluation of values;In networks;Industrial case study;Multi-criteria;Plans of actions;Virtual corporation,,,False,True,False,False
