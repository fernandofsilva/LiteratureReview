Conversely, knowledge in AI applications is more beneficial for large firms. Artificial intelligence (AI) is often seen as a key technology for future economic growth. However, some firms may have an advantage in utilizing AI knowledge to create radical innovation. This paper investigates the influence of AI-related knowledge in firms on the emergence of radical innovations with a specific focus on the differences between SMEs and large firms. We find that application-related AI knowledge increases the likelihood for radical innovations, while technique-related AI knowledge decreases it. Nevertheless, SMEs have an advantage in utilizing AI techniques to generate radical innovations. Thus, the principal implication of this study is that SMEs should focus on AI techniques, allowing them to capture unseen technological opportunities which cannot be obtained in a formalized R&D process within a large firm.        Artificial intelligence (AI) is often seen as a key technology for future economic growth. However, its concrete effects on the emergence of radical innovations and the associated socio-economic impacts, through increasing divergence between smaller and larger firms, have not yet been systematically researched. This paper addresses this by investigating the extent to which AI-related knowledge influences the emergence of radical innovations and differentiates between SMEs and large firms. Based on a unique dataset of European firms combining firm-level data with patent data, we find a nuanced influence from AI. While AI applications assert a positive influence, AI techniques negatively influence the emergence of radical innovations. Being an SME significantly moderates these effects. Larger firms gain from AI applications, whereas SMEs gain from AI techniques. Therefore, AI knowledge in itself is not a general answer to increase the likelihood of creating radical innovation. Instead, a more differentiated view on AI is needed.",Included,10.1007/s11187-022-00698-3,Radical innovations;Divergence;AI;Artificial intelligence;Firm level;RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT;RESOURCE-BASED VIEW;FIRM SIZE;TECHNOLOGICAL DIVERSIFICATION;ABSORPTIVE-CAPACITY;KNOWLEDGE;PRODUCTIVITY;RELATEDNESS;EXPLORATION;PERFORMANCE,,,,,True,"The article examines how SMEs use AI techniques to generate radical innovations, directly relating to AI adoption and its impact on SME performance and competitiveness."

A high-volume automotive paint line typically consists of miles of conveyor lines and dozens of sealing and painting robots equipped with hundreds of sensors and PLCs. It takes a body-in-white several hours to travel on conveyor tracks to complete the painting process. Throughout this process, thousands of process variables are monitored and collected from sensors and devices that control the automatic equipment. When a vehicle is painted, process variables and associated outcomes are collected in a centralized database called the Painted Surface Performance Management (PSPM) system. This database contains a complete history of each painted vehicle and its corresponding quality inspection results. In this work, machine learning (ML) models are used to select a list of the most important features that may affect the outcomes of the painted vehicles. However, this list needs to go through additional steps of feature investigations to validate true causal relationships between the selected features and the target variables. Once this step is completed, the selected features can then be used to target operational first time quality (FTQ) of products through use of such ML models to predict FTQ outcomes.

In this context, large-scale empirical evidence of the economic performance implications of adopting AI is poor, especially in the context of Small and Medium Sized Enterprises (SMEs). Drawing upon the Resource-Based View and the Digital Complementary Asset literature, we assessed whether the adoption of AI affects SMEs' revenue growth.Design/methodology/approachFirst, we examine the relationship between the adoption of AI and SMEs' revenue growth. Second, we assess whether AI complements the Internet of Things (IoT) and Big Data Analytics (BDA). We use firm-level data from the European Commission in 2020 on 11,429 European SMEs (Flash Eurobarometer 486).FindingsAmong the key findings, we found that ceteris paribus, the adoption of AI positively affects SMEs' revenue growth and, in conjunction with IoT and BDA, appears to be even more beneficial.Originality/valueOur results suggest that AI fosters SME growth, especially in combination with IoT and BDA. Thus, SME managers should be aware of the positive impacts of investments in AI and make decisions accordingly. Likewise, policymakers are aware of the positive effects of SMEs' reliance on AI, so they may design policies and funding schemes to push this digitalization of SMEs further.",Included,10.1108/INTR-02-2024-0195,Artificial intelligence;Revenue growth;Small and medium sized enterprises;Europe;Big data analytics;Internet of things;DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION;COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE;FIRM PERFORMANCE;MANAGEMENT;INTERNET;THINGS;TECHNOLOGY;INNOVATION;RESOURCES;ENTERPRISES,,,,,True,"The article directly investigates the impact of AI adoption on SMEs' revenue growth, addressing benefits and complementarity with other technologies, which aligns with the research focus on AI use in SMEs and its influence on performance and competitiveness."

Therefore, various downscaling approaches have been developed as a surrogate for the dynamical downscaling of GCMs. This study assesses the potential of using a cost-efficient machine learning alternative to dynamical downscaling by using the example case study of emulating surface mass balance (SMB) over the Antarctic Peninsula. More specifically, we determine the impact of the training framework by comparing two training scenarios: (a) a perfect and (b) an imperfect model framework. In the perfect model framework, the RCM-emulator learns only the downscaling function; therefore, it was trained with upscaled RCM (UPRCM) features at GCM resolution. This emulator accurately reproduced SMB when evaluated on UPRCM, but its predictions on GCM data conserved RCM-GCM inconsistencies and led to underestimation. In the imperfect model framework, the RCM-emulator was trained with GCM features and downscaled the GCM while exposed to RCM-GCM inconsistencies. This emulator predicted SMB close to the truth, showing it learned the underlying inconsistencies and dynamics. Our results suggest that a deep learning RCM-emulator can learn the proper GCM to RCM downscaling function while working directly with GCM data. Furthermore, the RCM-emulator presents a significant computational gain compared to an RCM simulation. We conclude that machine learning emulators can be applied to produce fast and fine-scaled predictions of RCM simulations from GCM data.",Excluded,10.1029/2022MS003593     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),machine learning;RCM-emulator;GCM downscaling;Antarctica;SURFACE MASS-BALANCE;EARTH SYSTEM MODEL;PRECIPITATION;ERRORS;CMIP5;MELT,,,,,False,"The article focuses on using machine learning for climate model downscaling, not on AI/ML adoption by SMEs or its impact on organizational performance and competitiveness."

The multi variant problem requires an operator to understand that the machining input parameters and choice of tooling will dictate the efficiency of generating surfaces with the appropriate tolerances. Ge is a brittle material and exhibits surface fracture when diamond turned. However, with the introduction of a negatively raked tool, surface fracture can be suppressed such that plastic flow of the material is possible. This paper focuses on the application and evaluation of machine learning methods to better assist the prediction of surface roughness parameters in Ge and provides a comparison with a well-understood ductile material, copper (Cu). Preliminary results show that both classic machine learning (ML) methods and artificial neural network (ANN) models offer improved predictive capability when compared with analytical prediction of surface roughness for both materials. Significantly, ML and ANN models were able to perform well for both Ge, a brittle material prone to surface fracture, and the more ductile Cu. ANN models offered the best prediction tool overall with minimal error. From a computational perspective, both ML and ANN models were able to achieve good results with smaller datasets than typical for many ML applications-which is beneficial since diamond turning can be costly.

The process to automate SME transaction execution is getting highly multifaceted as the number of stakeholders of SMEs is connecting, accessing, exchanging, adding, and changing the transactional executions. The balanced lifecycle of SMEs requires partnership exchanges, financial management, manufacturing, and productivity stabilities, along with privacy and security. Interoperability platform issue is another critical challenging aspect while designing and managing a secure distributed Peer-to-Peer industrial development environment for SMEs. However, till now, it is hard to maintain operations of SMEs' integrity, transparency, reliability, provenance, availability, and trustworthiness between two different enterprises due to the current nature of centralized server-based infrastructure. This paper bridges these problems and proposes a novel and secure framework with a standardized process hierarchy/lifecycle for distributed SMEs using collaborative techniques of blockchain, the internet of things (IoT), and artificial intelligence (AI) with machine learning (ML). A blockchain with IoT-enabled permissionless network structure is designed called ""B-SMEs"" that provides solutions to cross-chain platforms. In this, B-SMEs address the lightweight stakeholder authentication problems as well. For that purpose, three different chain codes are deployed. It handles participating SMEs' registration, day-to-day information management and exchange between nodes, and analysis of partnership exchange-related transaction details before being preserved on the blockchain immutable storage. Whereas AI-enabled ML-based artificial neural networks are utilized, the aim is to handle and optimize day-to-day numbers of SME transactions; so that the proposed B-SMEs consume fewer resources in terms of computational power, network bandwidth, and preservation-related issues during the complete process of SMEs service deliverance. The simulation results present highlight the benefits of B-SMEs, increases the rate of ledger management and optimization while exchanging information between different chains, which is up to 17.3%, and reduces the consumption of the system's computational resources down to 9.13%. Thus, only 14.11% and 7.9% of B-SME's transactions use network bandwidth and storage capabilities compared to the current mechanism of SMEs, respectively.",Included,10.1038/s41598-023-28707-9     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),,,,,,True,"The article discusses the use of AI, ML, and artificial neural networks in SMEs to optimize operations and improve efficiency, directly aligning with the research focus on AI technologies' impact on SME performance and competitiveness."

This study presents an analysis of AI adoption in SMEs by integrating the technology-organization-environment (TOE) framework with selected attributes from the diffusion of innovations (DOI) theory to examine adoption dynamics through a dual structural and perceptual lens. Empirical insights from sectoral and regional contexts are also incorporated. Ten critical challenges are identified and analyzed across the TOE dimensions, ranging from data access and skill shortages to cultural resistance, infrastructure limitations, and weak governance practices. Notably, the framework is expanded to incorporate responsible AI governance and democratized access to generative AI-particularly open-weight large language models (LLMs) such as LLaMA, DeepSeek-R1, Mistral, and FALCON-as emerging technological and ethical imperatives.

As it is a highly interdisciplinary field, requiring knowledge in computer science, statistics and the relevant application domain, experts are hard to find. Large corporations can sweep the job market by offering high salaries, which makes the situation for small and medium enterprises (SME) even worse, as they usually lack the capacities both for attracting specialists and for qualifying their own personnel. In order to meet the enormous demand in ML specialists, universities now teach ML in specifically designed degree programs as well as within established programs in science and engineering. While the teaching almost always uses practical examples, these are somewhat artificial or outdated, as real data from real companies is usually not available. The approach reported in this contribution aims to tackle the above challenges in an integrated course, combining three independent aspects: first, teaching key ML concepts to graduate students from a variety of existing degree programs; second, qualifying working professionals from SME for ML; and third, applying ML to real-world problems faced by those SME. The course was carried out in two trial periods within a government-funded project at a university of applied sciences in south-west Germany. The region is dominated by SME many of which are world leaders in their industries. Participants were students from different graduate programs as well as working professionals from several SME based in the region. The first phase of the course (one semester) consists of the fundamental concepts of ML, such as exploratory data analysis, regression, classification, clustering, and deep learning. In this phase, student participants and working professionals were taught in separate tracks. Students attended regular classes and lab sessions (but were also given access to e-learning materials), whereas the professionals learned exclusively in a flipped classroom scenario: they were given access to e-learning units (video lectures and accompanying quizzes) for preparation, while face-to-face sessions were dominated by lab experiments applying the concepts. Prior to the start of the second phase, participating companies were invited to submit real-world problems that they wanted to solve with the help of ML. The second phase consisted of practical ML projects, each tackling one of the problems and worked on by a mixed team of both students and professionals for the period of one semester. The teams were self-organized in the ways they preferred to work (e.g. remote vs. face-to-face collaboration), but also coached by one of the teaching staff. In several plenary meetings, the teams reported on their status as well as challenges and solutions. In both periods, the course was monitored and extensive surveys were carried out. We report on the findings as well as the lessons learned. For instance, while the program was very well-received, professional participants wished for more detailed coverage of theoretical concepts. A challenge faced by several teams during the second phase was a dropout of student members due to upcoming exams in other subjects.",Included,,Machine learning;qualification;interdisciplinary,,,,,True,"The article discusses the application of machine learning in SMEs, focusing on real-world problems and practical projects, which aligns with investigating how SMEs use ML and the challenges they face."

Scholars generally acknowledge the effectiveness of dynamic capabilities (DCs) and artificial intelligence (AI) applications in responding quickly to market uncertainties; however, their impact on boosting firm performance during real-time environmental turbulence requires further investigation. To address this gap, this study examined the influence of environmental turbulence on SME innovation using AI applications and DCs and how new opportunities can be leveraged to maintain a competitive advantage. This study adopted a quantitative approach, and survey data were collected from 487 managers and owners of SMEs that implemented DCs and AI during real-time environmental turbulence. The results indicate that the elements of environmental turbulence influence SMEs' implementation of both DCs and AI, acting as mediators between disruptive elements and enhancing firm performance during challenging times. The theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed in depth. (c) 2024 The Authors.

Filling the missing data presents a nontrivial challenge in existing techniques. Current naive methods for filling the missing data often lead to biased approximations or make false assumptions about the data and correlations of the data. This paper presents a physics-guided neural network (PGNN) method that integrates the deep learning method with the guidance of a physics-based model to effectively fill the missing data that caused by limitations in information collection. The PGNN method first determines the coefficients of a physics-based model of a certain process by using machine learning (ML)-based estimations instead of experiment-based calibration. The outputs of this estimated physics-based model will serve as additional inputs for the next-level deep learning model. A numerical case study is performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method by comparing it with other standard data-driven methods. The simulation results show that the PGNN method can more accurately fill the missing information and capture the uncertainty in the environment. (C) 2022 Society of Manufacturing Engineers (SME).

Based on a game with three financing options (bank financing, guarantee financing and direct financing), we investigate how AI influences financing preferences among ecommerce supply chain participants, which involve one capital-constrained and regretful SME, one e-commerce platform, and a bank. Firstly, our findings reveal that the impact of AI is not a clear-cut matter. AI may not consistently boost platform profitability under guarantee financing, platform needs to consider the production scale effect brought by AI against the potential default risk. Similarly, in direct financing, SME must strike a balance between the increase in output resulting from AI development and the potential impact of platform adjusting interest rates. Secondly, from the perspective of financing strategy space, it's evident that AI can be a positive force in encouraging all supply chain participants to enjoy platform financing services. Specifically, SME prefers direct financing over guarantor financing when the unit regret bias cost and production cost is low but the commission fee is high. Platform is more inclined to provide direct financing if unit production cost is low and unit commission fee is high. Otherwise, bank financing is preferred. As regret bias cost diminish, the strategy space for bank financing contracts. For the whole supply chain, all three types of financing may be options. Guarantee and direct financing gradually become more popular as SME uses AI at higher levels. Moreover, conclusions remain robust when SME is fully credit-constrained or platform is fully financially constrained.

Because of unequal resource allocation, constraints on the intelligent transformation of SMEs in central China are different from those in economically and technologically well-developed coastal provinces. Hence, the authors focus on SMEs in central China to identify drivers of and barriers to intelligent transformation. Design/methodology/approach The interview data were collected from 66 SMEs across 20 industries in central China. To verify the validity of the data collection method, the authors used two methods to control for retrospective bias: multi-level informants and enterprises' AI project application materials (Wei and Clegg, 2020). The final data were validated without conflicts. Next, the authors cautiously followed a two-step approach recommended by Venkatesh et al. (2010) and used NVivo 11.0 to analyze the collected text data. Findings SMEs in central China are enthusiastic about intelligent transformation while facing both internal and external pressures. SMEs need to pay attention to both internal (enterprise development needs, implementation cost, human resources and top management involvement) and external factors (external market pressure, convenience of AI technology and policy support) and their different impacts on intelligent transformation. However, constrained by limited resources, SMEs in central China have been forced to take a step-by-step intelligent transformation strategy based on their actual needs with the technological flexibility method in the short term. Originality/value Considering the large number of SMEs and their importance in promoting China's economic development and job creation (SME Bureau of MIIT, 2020), more research on SMEs with limited resources is needed. In the study, the authors confirmed that enterprises should handle ""social responsibility"" carefully because over-emphasizing it will hinder intelligent transformation. However, firms should pay attention to the role of executives in promoting intelligent transformation and make full use of policy support to access more resources.",Included,10.1108/IJOEM-06-2021-0985,Intelligent manufacturing;SMEs;Intelligent transformation;Artificial intelligence;MIXED-METHODS RESEARCH;INFORMATION;FRAMEWORK;ROBOTS;ORGANIZATION;PERFORMANCE;GUIDELINES;CONSUMER;INTERNET;SYSTEMS,,,,,True,"The article directly investigates how SMEs use AI for intelligent transformation, identifying drivers and barriers, which aligns with the research focus on AI adoption, benefits, challenges, and organizational impact in SMEs."

Various finite element analysis (FEA) software packages are used to perform structural analyses such as predicting the flow of strain or strain fields in a microstructure. Engineers frequently operate these software packages to evaluate mechanical behavior and predict failure. Even though these FEA software packages provide highly accurate analyses, they are computationally intensive, taking a significant amount of time to produce a solution. The time required by the FEA software packages to achieve accurate results largely depends on microstructure details and mesh resolution, thus providing a trade-off between fidelity and computation time. This research proposes the use of Deep Learning algorithms to achieve a significant reduction in the time required to predict high -accuracy strain fields in a two-dimensional microstructure with defects.

Artificial intelligence may facilitate the movement of US for pneumothorax into the prehospital setting. The large amount of training data required for conventional neural network methodologies has limited their use in US so far.METHODS: A limited training database was supplied by Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency of 30 patients, 15 cases with pneumothorax and 15 cases without. There were two US videos per patient, of which we were allowed to choose one to train on, so that a limited set of 30 videos were used. Images were annotated for ribs and pleural interface. The software performed anatomic reconstruction to identify the region of interest bounding the pleura. Three neural networks were created to analyze images on a pixel-by-pixel fashion with direct voting determining the outcome. Independent verification and validation was performed on a data set gathered by the Department of Defense.RESULTS: Anatomic reconstruction with the identification of ribs and pleura was able to be accomplished on all images. On independent verification and validation against the Department of Defense testing data, our program concurred with the SME 80% of the time and achieved a 86% sensitivity (18/21) for pneumothorax and a 75% specificity for the absence of pneumothorax (18/24).

CEBAF is a large, high-power continuous wave recirculating linac that utilizes 418 SRF cavities to accelerate electrons up to 12 GeV. Recent upgrades to CEBAF include installation of 11 new cryomodules (88 cavities) equipped with a low-level RF system that records RF time-series data from each cavity at the onset of an RF failure. Typically, subject matter experts (SME) analyze this data to determine the fault type and identify the cavity of origin. This information is subsequently utilized to identify failure trends and to implement corrective measures on the offending cavity. Manual inspection of large-scale, time-series data, generated by frequent system failures is tedious and time consuming, and thereby motivates the use of machine learning (ML) to automate the task. This study extends work on a previously developed system based on traditional ML methods (Tennant and Carpenter and Powers and Shabalina Solopova and Vidyaratne and Iftekharuddin, Phys. Rev. Accel. Beams, 2020, 23, 114601), and investigates the effectiveness of deep learning approaches. The transition to a DL model is driven by the goal of developing a system with sufficiently fast inference that it could be used to predict a fault event and take actionable information before the onset (on the order of a few hundred milliseconds). Because features are learned, rather than explicitly computed, DL offers a potential advantage over traditional ML. Specifically, two seminal DL architecture types are explored: deep recurrent neural networks (RNN) and deep convolutional neural networks (CNN). We provide a detailed analysis on the performance of individual models using an RF waveform dataset built from past operational runs of CEBAF. In particular, the performance of RNN models incorporating long short-term memory (LSTM) are analyzed along with the CNN performance. Furthermore, comparing these DL models with a state-of-the-art fault ML model shows that DL architectures obtain similar performance for cavity identification, do not perform quite as well for fault classification, but provide an advantage in inference speed.",Excluded,10.3389/frai.2021.718950     WE  - Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),time-series classification;fault identification;superconducting radio-frequency cavities;particle accelerator;LINAC;deep recurrent learning;convolutional neural networks;TIME-SERIES;SYSTEM,,,,,False,"The article focuses on deep learning for fault classification in superconducting radio-frequency cavities, not on AI/ML use in SMEs or their organizational performance and competitiveness."

During a CSE attack, malicious users will repeatedly use linguistic tricks to eventually deceive their victims. Thus, to protect SME users, it would be beneficial to have a cyber-defense mechanism able to detect persistent interlocutors who repeatedly bring up critical topics that could lead to sensitive data exposure. We build a natural language processing model, called CSE-PersistenceBERT, for paraphrase detection to recognize persistency as a social engineering attacker's behavior during a chat-based dialogue.

Three optimization strategies are presented: the two-steps optimization, the single optimization and a new version of the PSO algorithm, the Parallel PSO.

This study aims to develop an SME-specific ESG rating system that integrates both indirect and direct approaches. To facilitate responsible and reliable ESG evaluations, the indirect approach employs causal inference technique to identify the most relevant variables affecting ESG ratings in large listed companies. Subsequently, three machine learning-based predictive models are trained using this data, which are then applied to SMEs with a bridging strategy to derive their potential ESG ratings. The direct approach categorizes SMEs by industry and applies customized ESG performance indicators to assess their actual ESG ratings.

These incidents in RIRAS are reviewed by a radiation oncology subject matter expert (SME), who initially triages some incidents based on the salient elements in the incident report. To automate the triage process, we used the data from the VHA treatment centers and the VCU radiation oncology department. We used NLP combined with traditional ML algorithms, including support vector machine (SVM) with linear kernel, and compared it against the transfer learning approach with the universal language model fine-tuning (ULMFiT) algorithm. In RIRAS, severities are divided into four categories; A, B, C, and D, with A being the most severe to D being the least. In this work, we built models to predict High (A & B) vs. Low (C & D) severity instead of all the four categories. Models were evaluated with macro-averaged precision, recall, and F1-Score.

It is unknown whether ChatGPT provides quality responses to infectious diseases (ID) pharmacotherapy questions. This study surveyed ID pharmacist subject matter experts (SMEs) to assess the quality of ChatGPT version 3.5 (GPT-3.5) responses. Methods. The primary outcome was the percentage of GPT-3.5 responses considered useful by SME rating. Secondary outcomes were SMEs' ratings of correctness, completeness, and safety. Rating definitions were based on literature review. One hundred ID pharmacotherapy questions were entered into GPT-3.5 without custom instructions or additional prompts, and responses were recorded. A 0-10 rating scale for correctness, completeness, and safety was developed and validated for interrater reliability. Continuous and categorical variables were assessed for interrater reliability via average measures intraclass correlation coefficient and Fleiss multirater kappa, respectively. SMEs' responses were compared by the Kruskal-Wallis test and chi-square test for continuous and categorical variables. Results. SMEs considered 41.8% of responses useful.

Seasonal variation with increased temperatures and inconsistent precipitation as climate change consequences also affect the soil C-sequestration process globally. Soil-health management practices (SHMPs) such as cover crops, crop residues and manures increase organic components as well as soil-organic C (SOC) pool in an agroecosystem. While, soil microbial-biomass (SMB) which is considered as a soil-health metric to understand microbial community response, is still not modelled to relate with SOC and seasonal impacts to identify suitable SHMPs. Methods: Cover crops followed by 100% residue addition and combinations of manure +organic-fertilizer were the SHMPs for a winter-wheat system in our field study. Seasonal data regarding SOC, nitrogen, SMB-C and labile-C content of soils were used to machine-learn the system and understand the influence of different drivers on SMB-C. Results: The test models based on 'Multivariate Linear Regression' could explain 70% of the variability and predicted seasonal-variation as a dominant variant followed by SHMPs and soil-moisture. AdaBoost and Random Forest Models performed better than others if 'Ensemble Learning' was used. 'Feature Importance' predicted labile-C and aboveground-biomass as the two most important drivers impacting SMB-C. Conclusions: Ensemble Learning' method of Machine-Learning could be successfully implied to understand the SMB-C in an agroecosystem and set benchmark-strategies for soil-health improvement. 50% manure+ 50% fertilizer with crop-residue could be recommended for maximum labile-C and SOC in surface soil-layers.",Excluded,10.1016/j.atech.2023.100208,Carbon sequestration;Soil microbial-biomass carbon;Labile carbon;Soil-health management;Machine-learning agroecosystem;Precision agricultural management;Random Forest and AdaBoost models,,,,,False,"The article focuses on using machine learning for soil health and carbon sequestration in agriculture, not on AI/ML adoption by SMEs or its impact on organizational performance and competitiveness."

Numerous factors affect the surface roughness of SLM-manufactured parts, which have been reported in the literature, but mostly for bulk samples composed of several layers. In this work, single-layer raster scanning of Ti6Al4V samples are designed and fabricated. The influence of the four most dominant SLM process parameters, i.e., laser power, scanning speed, hatch spacing, and layer thickness on sample surface roughness is thoroughly investigated using a fractional factorial design. Surface roughness data, acquired by white-light interferometry, from 216 data sets are then used to train a machine learning model with the back-propagation method and predict the surface roughness based on the input process parameters. The results show that the laser power is the most significant parameter in determining the top surface roughness of samples. Interestingly, although the investigated samples are single layer raster scanning areas on a solid SLM-built sample with the same parameter set, the layer thickness has a contribution of 10% to 15% in the variations of the surface roughness of the single layers.

Methods: Seventy-six patients (mean age 8.38 +/- 0.88 years) underwent SME treatment for 11.04 +/- 4.44 months. Canine positions were categorized as labial ectopic (TE: n = 40) or normally positioned (TN: n = 112).

Whether the use case is providing remote technical support during assembly, test, inspection, integration, or troubleshooting and repair, today's commercial remote collaboration solutions face practical utilization challenges. Remote collaboration solutions rely on two-way video streaming. The deployment of these solutions is often restricted, or severely limited, to specific use cases in specific locations because of potential visual data spills. Mitigation of this risk currently means limiting where cameras are allowed and moving objects of interest (OOI) into rooms where cameras are deemed safe to use. Such limitations create a need for automatic filtering of live video streams which is easy for manufacturing and maintenance workers to use.        To address this need it is possible to modify and apply existing video processing solutions. The goal is to automatically limit the field of view to only the OOI and blur or remove the background prior to streaming. To accomplish this, one must identify the OOI and differentiate it from its visual background. This paper presents an investigation and application of machine learning (ML) background removal techniques. Discussion begins with basic approaches. The paper then transitions into more advanced ML methods of object recognition. This includes the possibility of improving ML methods by detecting staging volumes and restricting processing to such. Results will be discussed along with an overview of how implementing such methods can be achieved.

Recently developed matrix computation units for AI and high-performance computing provide new optimization opportunities for the FFT algorithm. Compared to dedicated matrix multiplication architectures like Intel AMXs, ARM's Scalable Matrix Extension (SME) provides more flexible outer product instructions to construct matrix multiplications in software. To leverage ARM SME's matrix multiplication capabilities, this paper proposes a novel optimized outer product pattern for the Cooley-Tukey FFT algorithm and presents OpenFFT-SME, the first FFT library for ARM SME based on this pattern. This pattern can reduce the number of outer product operations and memory accesses to the DFT matrix by exploiting the symmetric and periodic properties of twiddle factors in the DFT matrix. To further boost performance, OpenFFT-SME incorporates software pipelining to enhance execution pipelines in the assembly code kernels. Meanwhile, a butterfly network more suitable for this pattern is designed and integrated.

A structural equation modeling (SEM) path analysis was used to estimate the impact of customer-focus on the performance of SMEs.FindingsThe outcomes of this study indicate that customer-focus has a significant positive impact on SME performance, hence backing the current demand for investigating the distinct influence of customer-focus on SME performance. The results show that customer-focus has a positive and significant relationship with financial performance, customer performance, internal business process performance and learning and growth performance, thus supporting the literature on the positive impact of customer-focus on SME performance. Therefore, customer-focus determinants used in this study, including co-creation, networking ties, customer insight and artificial intelligence marketing (AIM), are critical to the optimization of SME performance.Research limitations/implicationsNotwithstanding the importance of this research study mentioned earlier, the study has limitations. Notably, the sample size of this study can be increased to capture SME respondents in other geographical zones that were not included in this study. Future research studies may address how business environment conditions moderate the relationship between customer focus and performance, and also the cause-effect of the relationship between customer focus and business environment conditions on SME performance.Practical implicationsThe practical implications consist of two main items. First, this study empowers SME owners and managers to develop a customer focus technique as a central strategic goal in their quest for SME performance optimization. Second, SME owners and managers should progressively exploit the four determinants of customer focus which include co-creation, networking ties, customer insight and (AIM in order to accrue important resources for effective utilization of their customer focus competences as a way to enhance their performance.Social implicationsThis study is targeted at the sound development of SMEs to bring about poverty alleviation and employment. Poverty, unemployment and poor living standards are recognized as vital social challenges in most emerging economies. The establishment of customer focus as an important strategic capability provides opportunities for SME survival, profitability and growth.Originality/valueGenerally, the findings of this research study provide a strong backing to RBV perspective and the proposition that customer-focus and its determinants (i.e. co-creation, networking ties, customer insight and AIM) should be acknowledged as a vital strategic resource for optimizing the performance of SMEs. This research study also provides new knowledge contribution to the present body of knowledge on customer-focus orientation and management literature, particularly in the context of an emerging economy.",Included,10.1108/AJEMS-04-2022-0167,Customer-focus;Performance;Business organization;Food processing SMEs;Ghana;ARTIFICIAL-INTELLIGENCE;CO-CREATION;COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE;BALANCED SCORECARD;ORIENTATION;MANAGEMENT;INNOVATION;STRATEGY;FIRMS;BRAND,,,,,True,"The article discusses the use of artificial intelligence marketing (AIM) as a determinant of customer-focus in SMEs and its impact on SME performance, aligning with the research focus on AI adoption and its influence on organizational performance in SMEs."

In the Antarctic ice sheet (AIS), DH mostly forms during summer insolation. The seasonal regularity provides an age marker for each internal snow/firn layer, which is necessary for estimating surface mass balance (SMB) using ice-penetrating radar (IPR) and ice core. However, little is known about DH inside the AIS because ice drill and snow pit observations are inefficient and sparse. The deployment of the Operation IceBridge (OIB) airborne snow radar has significantly enhanced the field observation dataset. So far, the spatial distribution of DH remains unclear due to the lack of DH extraction over the AIS from OIB snow radar. Based on instance segmentation SOLOv2 and self-attention mechanism Swin Transformer, a DH layer automatic extraction algorithm ST-SOLOv2 is proposed, with AP(50) of 0.9 and F1-score of 0.83, outperforms other commonly used instance segmentation networks (SOLOv2, Mask R-CNN, BlendMask, YOLACT, and CondInst). After the proposed preprocessing pipeline, we conduct the ST-SOLOv2 to locate each DH near the surface.

Real-time Artificial Intelligence (AI) based monitoring systems are on the rise as an alternative to post-processing inspection techniques with advances in sensing techniques and Deep Learning (DL). The article focuses on how the manifolds learnt by the embedded space of the two convolutional generative models, such as autoencoder, and Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), could be exploited to differentiate built conditions. The co-axially mounted CCD camera acquired the melt pool morphology corresponding to six build parameters covering the process map from Lack of Fusion (LoF) to conduction regime. The images acquired from the CCD camera constituted the dataset to train and test the model performance. After training, the latent space of both the networks would have captured the commonality and differences, i. e. unique manifolds of the melt pool morphologies corresponding to the six build conditions. The learned manifolds from the two trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) models were exploited by combining with One-Class SVM to classify the ideal build quality from the other conditions supervisedly. The prediction of the trained One-class SVM on the two latent spaces of the CNN models had an overall classification accuracy of similar to 97%.

In this article, we presented a combined approach of anomaly detection in LAN based on raw network traffic observation and measurement, the collected data being converted to regulated chunks of 480 bits. A network traffic dataset including multitype anomalies from a honeypot device in LAN was employed, with a total of two weeks' data. By further integrating the representation with supervised learning and knowledge-based labeling methods, we aim to classify raw network traffic thus detecting anomaly from raw data measurement without using manually crafted features. We conducted the model training against accuracy and evaluated the scheme based on a separated validation set against a metric of precision.

First, sequential motion executor (SME) is a three-layer interpretable neural network, where the first produces the sequentially propagating hidden states, the second constructs the corresponding triangular bases with minor non-neighbor interference, and the third maps the bases to the motor commands. Second, the AGOL algorithm prioritizes the update of the parameters with high relevance score, allowing the learning to focus more on the highly relevant ones. Thus, these two components lead to an analyzable framework, where each sequential hidden state/basis represents the learned key poses/robot configuration.

The determination of the OEE is oftentimes not transparent in companies, due to the heterogeneous data sources and manual interference. Furthermore, there is a difference in present guidelines to calculate the OEE. Due to a big amount of sensor data in Cyber Physical Production Systems, Machine Learning methods can be used in order to detect several elements of the OEE by a trained model. Changeover time is one crucial aspect influencing the OEE, as it adds no value to the product. Furthermore, changeover processes are fulfilled manually and vary from worker to worker. They always have their own procedure to conduct a changeover of a machine for a new product or production lot. Hence, the changeover time as well as the process itself vary.

Nanometer biotechnology is more widely used in the entrainment system of drug carriers and the development for new pharmaceutical preparations. Ultraviolet irradiation to human skin in the long term can result in photaging and photocarcinogenesis. The purpose of this study was to observe the biological features of tocopherol submicron emulsion (vitE SME) and to clarify the roles of vitE SME on UVB-induced photodamage in HaCaT keratinocytes (KC). VitE SME was prepared by high-pressure homogenization and microemulsion technique. HaCaT KC was incubated in the culture medium supplied with 1/200 and 11400 of VitE SME prior to different dosages of UVB irradiation. The vitamin E amount in the culture medium was measured by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Cell growth and cellular viability was detected by MTT assay. The amount of vitamin E remaining in the culture medium significantly decreased during the first 8 h, and less than 10% can be detected by the terminal experiment (24 h). No cytotoxicity effect of tocopherol NM on HaCat KC was observed. In contrast to the control group, the cellular viability VitE SME-treated group increased 44.22% by 24 h. Compared with irradiated groups without VitE SME, cell proliferation decreased by 17.77% and 40.42% when the HaCaT KC was irradiated with 30 ml/cm(2) and 90 ml/cm(2) UVB irradiation, respectively. VitE SME has no toxicity to cell culture system and is characterized by stable release and penetration. Pre-incubation with VitE SME can partly reduce UV-induced cell damage, and the photoprotective efficiency to UVB irradiation also shows time dependence. (C) 2007 Prous Science.

The dimension of the actuator devices vary with respect to the application and environment it is deployed for. Small devices possess lesser operational capacity due to their limited memory space. Memory management in the devices is vital to improve the rate of processing and response of these devices. This article proposes a Selective Memory Balancing (SMB) technique for effective handling of memory to improve the rate of response of the actuator devices. The memory balancing scheme is built upon sequential machine learning algorithm that analyzes the periodic behavior of the device in handling requests. Based on the analysis, the available memory space is allocated and freed for receiving requests and storing information. The learning process is persuaded through time-dependent transmission behavior observations. This memory management technique operates in an adaptive manner for servicing time-critical and non-delay tolerant applications by minimizing storage and access delay at the device level. The proposed technique is intended to minimize memory exploitation, service delay and to increase the request processing rates. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The relationship between validation metrics (input) and SME scores (output) is formulated as a classification problem, and a probabilistic neural network (PNN) is constructed to execute this mapping. Establishing PNN classifiers for a wide variety of combinations of validation metrics allows for a quantitative comparison of validation metric performance in representing SME judgment. An advantage to this approach is that it semi-automates the model validation process and subsequently is capable of incorporating the contributions of large data sets of disparate response quantities of interest in model validation assessment. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated on a complex real-world problem involving the shock qualification testing of a floating shock platform. A data set of experimental and simulated pairs of time history comparisons along with associated SME scores and computed validation metrics is obtained and utilized to construct the PNN classifiers through K-fold cross validation. A wide range of validation metrics for time history comparisons is considered including feature-specific metrics (phase and magnitude error), a frequency metric (shock response spectra), a time-frequency metric (wavelet decomposition), and a global metric (index of agreement). The PNN classifiers constructed using a Parzen kernel for the class conditional probability density function whose smoothing parameter is optimized using a genetic algorithm performs well in representing SME judgment.

A subcutaneous osmotic pump was employed to deliver approximately 2.5 .mu.g GnRH per hour for 6 to 7 d following norgestomet implant removal. In Experiment 1, suckled Brahman crossbred cows (n = 221) were assigned randomly to one of four treatments: 1) SMB (n = 58); 2) SMB+48-h CR (SMB+CR, n = 55); 3) SMB+GnRH (n = 56); and 4) SMB+CR+GnRH (n = 52). Virgin heifers (n = 69), 12 to 14 months of age, were allotted to Treatments 1 and 3. The CR (cows) and GnRH (cows and heifers) treatments began at SMB implant removal and all females were inseminated 48 h later. Experiment 2 assessed luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion following SMB implant removal and (or) osmotic pump insertion in 44 cyclic cows (n = 11/treatment group) treated as in Experiment 1. Cows received SMB treatment either early (Days 3 to 5) or late (Days 11 to 15) in the estrous cycle (n = 22/period). Conception rate at timed AI for SMB+CR was superior (50.9%; P<0.025) to all other treatments (SMB, 27.5%: SMB+GnRH, 26.9%; SMB+CR+GnRH 26.9%). Gonadotropin-releasing hormone attenuated the positive effects of CR by reducing (P<0.02) cumulative pregnancy rates on Day 24 in SMB+CR+GnRH cows. Conception at timed AI in virgin SMB heifers (52.9%) was higher (P<0.025) than SMB+GnRH heifers (25.7%), and it remained higher (P<0.05) on Day 24 (85.3% vs 60.0%). Gonadotropin-releasing hormone stimulated a premature, preovulatory-like surge of LH which peaked 6.8.+-.0.6 h following pump insertion.

For the development of sustainable entrepreneurship in recent years, business schools worldwide have recognised their roles, and started providing entrepreneurship education (EE). Due to being in emerging phase, the EE at business schools is following pedagogic approaches that are not exclusively developed for entrepreneurship, and hence, not suitable with the practical entrepreneurial needs. This leaves graduates lacking in many types of entrepreneurial skill-sets. One of those key skill-sets is entrepreneurial marketing (EM), which is one of the most dominating problems for SME entrepreneurs for the survival and growth of their businesses. Furthermore, the literature highlights that lack of EM skill-set is also one of the leading causes of entrepreneurial failure. The failure of SME entrepreneurs not only discourages them, but also damages the initiatives taken by the governments and private institutions for entrepreneurship development in the economies. Thus, considering the critical importance of EM education for the development of entrepreneurship, this paper has highlighted the pedagogical gaps in EM education, proposed future research avenues, and made practical implications for business schools' academic authorities to upgrade their pedagogical models.",Excluded,10.1016/j.ijme.2020.100379     WE  - Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Entrepreneurship development;Entrepreneurship education;Entrepreneurial marketing;SME entrepreneur;Entrepreneurial failure;Pedagogy;Theory-practice gap;Business school;BUSINESS;MANAGEMENT;SMES;CHALLENGES;IMPACT;SKILLS;REFLECTIONS;EMPLOYMENT;UNIVERSITY;INTENTION,,,,,False,"The article focuses on entrepreneurship education and entrepreneurial marketing skills for SMEs, without addressing the use of AI, ML, DL, ANN, or NN technologies in SME operations."

This study proposed a reinforcement learning irrigation (RL-Irr) algorithm incorporating tree growth stages, soil moisture, and weather conditions to determine precise irrigation needs. The algorithm was developed by calibrating the AQUACROP model using data from actual durian plantations where rain-fed irrigation (rain-fed) was practised. Daily irrigation volumes were calculated based on real-time soil moisture, weather forecasts, and weekly tree growth measurements. The reinforcement learning method was used to optimise irrigation schedules, with rewards based on soil moisture, tree growth, rainfall, and weather conditions. The algorithm was tested using AQUACROP simulations and compared against soil moisture balance irrigation (SMB-Irr) and rain-fed. The results showed that the RL-Irr reduced water use by up to 75 percent while maintaining tree growth.

This process involves consolidation of metal powder using a heat source such as laser or electron beam. During the formation of three-dimensional(3D) objects by sintering metal powders layer by layer, many different thermal phenomena occur that can create defects or anomalies on the final printed part. Similar to other additive manufacturing techniques, PBF has been in practice for decades, yet it is still going through research and development endeavors which is required to understand the physics behind this process. Defects and deformations highly impact the product quality and reliability of the overall manufacturing process; hence, it is essential that we understand the reason and mechanism of defect generation in PBF process and take appropriate measures to rectify them. In this paper, we have attempted to study the effect of processing parameters (scanning speed, laser power) on the generation of defects in PBF process using a graph-based artificial neural network that uses numerical simulation results as input or training data. Use of graph-based machine learning is novel in the area of manufacturing let alone additive manufacturing or powder bed fusion.

Over time, the over rolling of these contaminants will cause indentations to appear in bearing elements, accelerating the reduction of bearing remaining useful life. Hence, it is possible to use contamination to accelerate bearing damage in experimental conditions to generate failure data using purposeful failure methodologies. This paper explores the methodology for inducing bearing contamination, detecting bearing contamination based on sensor signals, and subsequently predicting the expected useful life by incorporating the bearing contamination characteristics. First, bearing data was generated from three separate cases of varying contamination level to create labeled bearing contamination data. The data was determined as separable based on di fferences in the time and frequency data using Fourier and statistical analysis. Second, the bearing contamination factor was determined using data-driven machine learning for each bearing to determine the ISO Life Modification Factor from ISO 281. Using di fferent algorithms, the contamination factor was predicted within a 94% accuracy for each algorithm over a five-fold crossvalidation, except for the neural network. Afterwards, the bearing useful life was assessed using the ISO life modification factor, based on the contamination factor, to determine the trend of bearing useful life under varying speed conditions and contamination factors. For future work, additional work is required for accounting changing parameters, such as bearing viscosity and load varying applications.

Methods and results: Using data from the National Cardiovascular Data Registry for implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) linked to Medicare administrative claims for longitudinal follow-up, we applied three statistical approaches to safety-signal detection for commonly used dual-chamber ICDs that used two propensity score (PS) models: one specified by subject-matter experts (PS-SME), and the other one by machine learning-based selection (PS-ML). The first approach used PS-SME and cumulative incidence (time-to-event), the second approach used PS-SME and cumulative risk (Data Extraction and Longitudinal Trend Analysis [DELTA]), and the third approach used PS-ML and cumulative risk (embedded feature selection).

Predicting lipophilicity, measured by LogP (1-octanol-water distribution coefficient logarithm), and acidity/basicity, measured by pK(a) (negative of acid ionization constant logarithm), is essential for early drug discovery success. However, the limited availability of experimental data and poor accuracy of standard LogP and pK(a) assessment methods for saturated fluorine-containing derivatives pose a significant challenge to achieving satisfactory results for this compound class. To overcome this challenge, we compiled a unique dataset of saturated fluorinated and corresponding non-fluorinated derivatives with LogP and pK(a) experimental values.

The interest in such areas as dynamic modelling of food processes   as increased, not least due to dramatic improvement and availability of the calculation methods and hardware. In the present case, flat bread extrusion was used as an example food process. Dynamic changes of torque, specific mechanical energy (SME) and pressure were identified (modelled) and control ed using two independently taught feed-forward artificial neural networks (ANN). SME, torque and pressure are system parameters which can be controlled with process parameters, such as feed moisture, mass feed rate and screw speed. Target parameters, such as product expansion index, bulk density, etc. are normally difficult to measure on-line, but can be estimated as functions the system parameters. For the modelling of the whole flat bread extrusion cooking process a MIMO (multi input and multi output) approach was necessary. The neural network topology for the process model was 21-9-3 and for the controller 18-20-2. The process model was taught with 629 real data samples and the controller with 115 synthetic samples created with the process model.

Despite the successful development, the main limitation of most existing methods lies in the assumption that the training and testing data are collected from the same distribution, i.e. the same machine under identical condition. However, this assumption is difficult to be met in the real industries, since the diagnostic model is generally expected to be applied on new machines. In order to address this issue, a deep learning-based cross-machine health identification method is proposed for industrial vacuum pumps, which are of great importance in the manufacturing industry but have received far less research attention in the literature. Generalized diagnostic features can be learnt using the proposed domain adaptation technique with maximum mean discrepancy metric. The health identification model learnt from the training machines can be well applied on new machines. Experiments on a real-world vacuum pump dataset validate the proposed method, which is promising for industrial applications. (c) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

It has a high level of flexibility in design and manufacturing, which provides a unique opportunity for producing parts with complex geometries that are not feasible using conventional subtractive manufacturing. Due to the sensitivity of AM to machine settings and process conditions, process shifts are oftentimes incurred in AM, which introduce defects and impact the quality and reliability of AM products. As such, it is critical to identify AM process shifts, especially at the incipient stage, for quality assurance. Most existing approaches, however, are limited in their ability to detect small AM process shifts. In this study, a structured light scanner is used to capture 3D point clouds from printed surfaces. A deep learning framework is introduced to extract useful information from point cloud data to delineate geometric variations of the printed surface and detect process shifts. The research methodology is evaluated and validated using both simulation studies and real-world applications. Experimental results have shown that the deep learning approach is with remarkable ability in detecting small process shifts and it outperforms convolutional neural network models when large amounts of training samples are not available.

Alkali-activated concrete (AAC) has emerged as a sustainable alternative to conventional OPC-based concrete, offering significant environmental benefits while providing desirable mechanical properties for structural applications. This study investigates the application of extreme gradient boosting regression (XGBR) algorithms to model the static modulus of elasticity (SME) of AAC, addressing the complexity of predicting SME by exploring the impact of different base learners on XGBR performance. Advancing beyond conventional approaches, this work integrates alternative base learners-namely artificial neural networks (ANN) and support vector regressors (SVR)-within the XGBR framework and systematically compares their performance with the widely adopted decision tree (DT) base learner. The models were developed and validated on a comprehensive database of AAC mixes, encompassing diverse material compositions and reactivities, mixture designs, and curing conditions. Results of Wilcoxon signed-rank test and the paired t-test showed that while the DT-based XGBR achieved the lowest error metrics during development, the novel SVR-based XGBR exhibited comparable generalisation performance on unseen data, outperforming the ANN-based XGBR. Interpretability analyses, including SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and permutation feature importance, identified compressive strength, total water content, and sodium oxide (Na2O) content of the activator as key predictors of SME. Several interactions among factors influencing the system's chemistry and polymerisation reactions were revealed through partial dependence analysis to investigate the optimal chemical conditions. The findings underscore the efficacy of XGBR ensembles for modelling complex AAC properties, providing insights for optimising sustainable material design to meet the urgent need for environmentally responsible construction solutions.",Excluded,10.1016/j.engappai.2025.111066     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Alkali-activated concrete;Static modulus of elasticity;Extreme gradient boosting machine;Decision tree;Support vector regressor;Artificial neural network;ASH-BASED GEOPOLYMER;MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES;ENGINEERING PROPERTIES;STRENGTH;MICROSTRUCTURE;SLAG,,,,,False,"The article focuses on modeling properties of alkali-activated concrete using machine learning techniques, not on AI adoption by SMEs or its impact on organizational performance and competitiveness."

A machine learning methodology, based on an alternating diffusion process, is applied for organizing the SMEs into a network/graph, and generating management profiles. The method relies on ideas from non-linear dimensionality reduction, where a data-set is parameterized by a small number of intrinsic parameters. Recent advances in this field allow for the construction of a common intrinsic representation for two related dataset by using kernel multiplication. In this work, the method is applied to two related datasets that describe a business from two angles: strategic planning and performance. The goal is to reveal underlying hidden strategic patterns that influence SMEs' performance.        The proposed methods are applied to a dataset containing planning and performance measures of 467 businesses. The obtained model yields an SME graph, where SMEs that share similar planning strategies and performances are located close to each other. Thus, the model generates typical strategic planning and performance profiles, describing distinct groups of SMEs. The study reveals two different planning strategies emphasizing different management approaches that lead to successful performance. Thus, in service SMEs there is more than one way to enhance performance via management strategy.

These technologies would create smart education; however, barriers cause challenges to apply these technologies and create modern areas like e-learning and MOOCs. It is required to indicate these barriers and find out solutions to apply them and change humans' life to maintain the world. In this paper we will introduce the DOOST SME. RANKING (DSRM) Model invented by Prof. Doost, through the 5th wave theory as solutions for Educational SMEs Development and learning and educational concerns in the future of 4th industrial revolution. In other words, this paper is a picture of the current business project environment in Educational SMEs Ranking. One of the primary objectives of this research is to allow educational actors, managers, policy makers, professors, researchers, and trainees to attain a more accurate understanding of the financial-educational economic structure of SMEs in educational sectors and also their scale of activities. This research was made by FHM German Institute of SMEs (F-GISI) and FHM Center for Sustainable Governance (CSG), as a best practice Germany. Firstly, we have started with ""DOOST -SME Code"" and we provide a SME code for SMEs to sift them with some conditions e.g. financial income and then introduce them for the next step. If some of the SMEs don't have enough abilities to move to the next step can get management consulting and training support from ""DOOST -SME Clinic"" to improve their situation for the next ranking project. We have categorized the SMEs (have all conditions of the first step) based on customized Guter Mittelstand German Best Practices categorization methods in 4 main groups: 1) Productive, 2) Service based, 3) Contactor, and 4) Knowledge based. Based on the ""DOOST -SME Code"", we have 17 categories: (1)Energy, (2)Agriculture and environmental, (3)Food industry, (4)Health, social welfare and insurance, (5) Human Resources, (6)Dress and clothing, (7)Logistics, mobility and transportation, (8)Procurement, (9)Hotel and tourism, (10)Construction and manufacturing, (11)Education and research, (12)Telecommunication, (13)Digitalization, IoT and smartness, (14)Finance and investment, (15)Automotive and machinery, (16)Recycling and waste & wastewater management, and (17)Others.

To that end, it focuses on digital technologies that integrate social and technical resources and offer the best possible product and service to its customers. Few real-world studies have been done on the social and technical aspects of Q4.0. Thus, the purpose of this study is to investigate empirically the impact of social and technical Q4.0 on I4.0 technologies and circular economy practices (CEP) in small- and medium-sized (SME) manufacturing enterprises. A framework based on the resource-based view (RBV) theory is developed and empirically validated by an online questionnaire of 189 Malaysian SME manufacturing enterprises. In contrast to the other existent QM investigations, which made use of structural equation modelling (SEM), this study performed an analysis in two stages. First, the Q4.0 practices that significantly influence I4.0 technologies and CEP are identified using the SEM approach. Second, the significant predictors obtained from SEM are ranked according to their relative importance using the artificial neural network (ANN) technique. The findings indicate that social and technical Q4.0 practices have improved I4.0 technologies and CEP. The findings also highlight the role performed by technical Q4.0 practices as a mediator between social Q4.0 practices, I4.0 technologies, and CEP. The findings of ANN highlight that the role of social and technical Q4.0 are crucial to the successful deployment of I4.0 technologies and CEP in manufacturing companies. The purpose of the current research is to shed light on the importance of Q4.0 multidimensions, hence contributing to theory application, especially given the scarcity of multidimensional perspectives of Q4.0 literature. In essence, the SEM-ANN methodology adds something new to the bodies of literature on Q4.0, I4.0, and CEP. As an outcome of the research, organisations can develop innovative strategies to adopt Q4.0 by gaining a better understanding of the elements that contribute to effective Q4.0 implementation in the digital transformation era.",Included,10.3390/su142315495     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)     WE  - Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Quality 4;0;Industry 4;circular economy practices;ANN;RESOURCE-BASED VIEW;MEDIATING ROLE;HARD TQM;SOFT TQM;PERFORMANCE;MANAGEMENT;INNOVATION;IMPLEMENTATION,,,,,True,"The study investigates the use of artificial neural networks (ANN) in SMEs within the context of Industry 4.0 technologies, focusing on digital transformation and quality management, which aligns with the research on AI and neural networks adoption in SMEs and their impact on organizational performance."

For example, assessing the workpiece quality in an early machining stage can be used to alter the quality control strategy, to increase the product quality, and to reduce the number of scrap parts which leads to savings in terms of time, resources, and cost. In this work, torque measurements obtained from the numerical control of a milling-machine in the serial production of hydraulic valves are used to predict the concentricity as well as the diameter of drilled and reamed bores of the valves. Statistical features are determined out of the torque measurements, which are presented as time series. The prediction of the quality is achieved with the machine learning method of random forest (RF) on the basis of the extracted features. The Pearson correlation between the features and the quality characteristics as well as the learning curves of the RF method are studied. It turns out, that a strong correlation comes along with a fast decreasing learning curve of the RF but gives no information over the achievable prediction accuracy with the RF. The obtained predictions are very precise and evaluated with four statistical criteria. A mean absolute error of 17.1 gm for the concentricity and only 0.27 gm for the diameter is achieved. In addition, the coefficients of determination of the concentricity and the diameter are 96.3% and 94.1% respectively, very high. It can be stated, that for the considered use case in this paper, a precise quality prediction on the basis of torque measurements and RF could be implemented which would make a much faster and efficient quality control possible.

SMB was administered 8 or 9 days after oestrus, approximately 30 days after hysterectomy. This study was conducted to determine if the uterus was necessary for SMB to induce luteolysis. SMB induced premature luteolysis as only 20% of the intact SMB-treated heifers had greater than or equal to 0.75 ng/ml of progesterone 7 days after the time of SMB treatment, compared to all (100%) of the untreated heifers (p < 0.05). By 9 days after the time of SMB treatment, 25% of the untreated heifers and none (0%) of the intact SMB-treated heifers had greater than or equal to 0.75 ng/ml of progesterone; however, all (100%) of the hysterectomized SR IB-treated heifers had 2 0.75 ng/ml of progesterone (p < 0.05). Therefore, SMB-induced luteolysis required the involvement of the uterus. The luteolysin, prostaglandin F-2 alpha is probably the secretion from the uterus that mediates the SMB-induced luteolysis. SMB treatment, however, required 7-8 days to induce luteolysis. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

Meanwhile, researchers historically design NLP pipelines with non-technical language in mind. This means industrial implementations are built on tools intended for non-technical use cases, suffering from a lack of verification, validation, and ultimately, personnel trust. To mitigate these sources of risk, we encourage a holistic, domain-driven approach to using NLP in a technical engineering setting, a paradigm we refer to as Technical Language Processing (TLP).

However, the cross-domain fault diagnostic problem still remains a challenging issue, where the training and testing data are collected from different operating conditions of the machine. To bridge the domain gap in the training and testing data and increase the model generalization ability, a domain adaptation approach is proposed in this paper within the deep learning framework. Multiple convolutional operations are employed for automatic feature extraction. The maximum mean discrepancy is used to optimize the distributions of the learned features for accurate diagnosis. To further enhance the model generalization ability, the health condition labels of the data are injected with additional noise during model training. Experiments on a bearing fault diagnosis dataset are carried out for validation. The results show that, compared with the popular transfer learning algorithms, the proposed method with noisy health labels can successfully improve the cross-domain diagnosis performance on rotating machines.

Studies have shown that serum creatine kinase (CK) >1000 U/L as a serological diagnostic criterion for RM does not reflect the risk of AKI or mortality. Methods This longitudinal cohort study included all patients with EHS who were admitted to intensive care unit between January 2008 and June 2019. Serum myoglobin (sMb) was studied as the serological marker of RM and compared with CK. Outcome events were AKI and 90-day mortality. Results A total of 161 patients were enrolled, of whom 52 (32.3%) had sMb >= 1000 ng/mL. Patients with sMb >= 1000 ng/mL had higher SOFA score, higher APACHE II score, lower GCS score, and higher incidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation, acute myocardial injury, acute liver injury, AKI, and 90-day mortality than patients with sMb <1000 ng/mL. Lymphocytes, neutrophils, D-Dimer were risk factors for AKI in patients with sMb >= 1000 ng/mL.

I apply this framework to the context of the digital revolution and focus on the impact of big data on firms' digitalization priorities. By leveraging a large-scale survey of more than twenty thousand Italian firms of all sizes, I find that big data improves the digitalization awareness of firms only if they gather big data from more than one source (otherwise, counterintuitively, it may even decrease it).

In order to improve the quality of the manufactured parts and reduce costs, it is important to timely and accurately monitor the AM process during manufacturing. However, it remains a challenging task due to the high complexity of the AM process and the difficulty in processing the condition monitoring data. This paper proposes a deep learning-based process monitoring method for directed energy deposition in AM. The thermal images collected during manufacturing are used to identify the process condition, and a deep convolutional neural network model is proposed to build an end-to-end condition monitoring framework. Experiments on a real directed energy deposition dataset in AM are carried out for validation. The results suggest the proposed method offers a promising approach in process monitoring based on the industrial images. Furthermore, little prior knowledge on signal processing and AM is required, that largely facilitates the potential applications in the real industrial scenarios. (c) 2020 The Authors.

The volume of individual case safety reports (ICSRs) increases yearly, but it is estimated that more than 90% of AEs go unreported. In this landscape, embracing assistive technologies at scale becomes necessary to obtain a higher yield of AEs, to maintain compliance, and transform the PV professional work life.AimThe aim of this study was to identify areas across the PV value chain that can be augmented by cognitive service solutions using the methodologies of contextual analysis and cognitive load theory. It will also provide a framework of how to validate these PV cognitive services leveraging the acceptable quality limit approach.MethodsThe data used to train the cognitive service were an annotated corpus consisting of 20,000 ICSRS from which we developed a framework to identify and validate 40 cognitive services ranging from information extraction to complex decision making. This framework addresses the following shortcomings: (1) needing subject-matter expertise (SME) to match the artificial intelligence (AI) model predictions to the gold standard, commonly referred to as ground truth' in the AI space, (2) ground truth inconsistencies, (3) automated validation of prediction missing context, and (4) auto-labeling causing inaccurate test accuracy. The method consists of (1) conducting contextual analysis, (2) assessing human cognitiveworkload,(3) determining decision points for applying artificial intelligence (AI), (4) defining the scope of the data, or annotated corpus required for training and validation of the cognitive services, (5) identifying and standardizing PV knowledge elements, (6) developing cognitive services, and (7) reviewing and validating cognitive services.ResultsBy applying the framework, we (1) identified 51 decision points as candidates for AI use, (2) standardized the process to make PV knowledge explicit, (3) embedded SMEs in the process to preserve PV knowledge and context, (4) standardized acceptability by using established quality inspection principles, and (5) validated a total of 126 cognitive services.ConclusionThe value of using AI methodologies in PV is compelling; however, as PV is highly regulated, acceptability will require assurances of quality, consistency, and standardization.

While efforts have been made over the years to develop automated systems that utilize known process capabilities for process selection and manufacturability assessment of part designs, such systems are hampered by the lack of a systematic approach to capture and model the shape, material property, and part quality transformation capabilities from design and manufacturing data. In this paper, the shape transformation capabilities of representative machining operations are modeled using 3D Variational Autoencoders and Generative Adversarial Networks (3D-VAE-GANs.) The proposed approach models the shape transformation capability as a latent probability distribution from which visualizations of realistic machinable features can be sampled for shape decomposition and reconstruction, thereby assisting machining process selection by a process planner and manufacturability assessment of part shapes generated by a designer.

Owing to the complexities of the feed composition and operational variables, a mathematical dynamic model using limited experimental parameters and data-driven machine learning using real industrial data were both employed to evaluate SMB performance. The developed dynamic model could evaluate the purity, recovery, and solvent consumption. Under standard operating conditions, the simulation results indicated that the extracted n-paraffin purity was 99.6%; and the recoveries of nC10, nC12, and nC14 were 95.7%, 88.9%, and 81.6%, respectively. The analysis of the counter-current ratio in each zone suggested that recovery can be enhanced by decreasing the Zone I and IIb ratios and increasing the Zone III ratio. In particular, controlling the Zone III became more important as the carbon-chain-length increased. An additional second desorbent stream in the n-paraffin SMB, known as zone flush, played an important role in further improving the purity of the extracted n-paraffin. The machine learning results clearly presented the importance of zone flush on impurity removal, which could not be sufficiently estimated from the dynamic model. The increase in p-xylene content in the zone flush contributed to a reduction in aromatic impurities in the extract. Owing to the nature of the industrial data obtained in a limited operation range, it was recommended that the mathematical and data-driven models should be used complementarily. Since the subsequent fractionation section consumed a significantly larger amount of energy than the SMB itself, an exergy analysis was conducted on the overall n-paraffin SMB process integrated with the fractionation section and potential improvements were suggested. The results will contribute to the establishment of design and operation guidelines for improving n-paraffin SMB performance. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Excluded,10.1016/j.seppur.2022.120597,Dynamic modeling;Exergy analysis;Machine learning;Normal paraffin (n-paraffin);Simulated moving bed chromatography (SMB);Chromatography;Dynamic models;Exergy;Machine learning;Recovery;Removal;Dynamics models;Exergy Analysis;Feed compositions;Industrial datum;Multicomponents;Normal paraffin;Operational variables;Performance;Simulated moving bed chromatography;Paraffins,,,,,False,"The article focuses on machine learning applied to chemical process optimization in industrial chromatography, not on AI/ML use in SMEs or their organizational performance and competitiveness."

The event catalog consists of 7377 events with magnitudes M-c ranging from -2 and lower up to 5.8. Events were subdivided into six populations based on location and source type: tectonic earthquakes (TEs), mining-induced events (MIEs), and mining blasts from four known mines (WMB, SMB, LMB, and CQB). The AR approach jointly exploits Pg-to-Sg phase ARs and Rg-to-Sg spectral ARs in multivariate quadratic discriminant functions and was able to classify 370 events with high signal quality from the three groups with sufficient size (TE, MIE, and SMB). For that subset of the events, the method achieved success rates between about 80% and 90%. The ML approach used trained convolutional neural network (CNN) models to classify the populations.

Demand forecasting is one of the biggest challenges of post-pandemic logistics. It appears that logistics management based on demand prediction can be a suitable alternative to the just-in-time concept. This study aims to identify the effectiveness of AI-based and statistical forecasting models versus practice-based models for SMEs and large enterprises in practice. The study compares the effectiveness of the practice-based Prophet model with the statistical forecasting models, models based on artificial intelligence, and hybrid models developed in the academic environment. Since most of the hybrid models, and the ones based on artificial intelligence, were developed within the last ten years, the study also answers the question of whether the new models have better accuracy than the older ones. The models are evaluated using a multicriteria approach with different weight settings for SMEs and large enterprises. The results show that the Prophet model has higher accuracy than the other models on most time series. At the same time, the Prophet model is slightly less computationally demanding than hybrid models and models based on artificial neural networks. On the other hand, the results of the multicriteria evaluation show that while statistical methods are more suitable for SMEs, the prophet forecasting method is very effective in the case of large enterprises with sufficient computing power and trained predictive analysts. © 2022, Centre of Sociological Research.

Improving on existing research and its methodological limitations, we provide an understanding of the digital transformation in SMEs by approaching the research from a non-linear and complex perspective. We empirically test our hypotheses using the Eurostat Flash Eurobarometer No. 486 data set, with a final sample of 16,365 SMEs. Our first contribution shows that an adequate understanding of digital transformation not only implies the identification of drivers of digitalisation but also a grasp of how these drivers act, highlighting the differential effect that internal capabilities and external support of the company in interaction have on digital transformation. Moreover, the results show that the effect of interactions between variables is transferred to the output variable in a non-linear process, which may contain an optimum produced by a differential combination of input variables. Second, the paper extends the research methodology, emphasising the importance of combining classic regression analysis with machine-learning techniques.

Thus, we conducted a study to determine the effects of eCG and P.G. 600 on the timing of estrus and ovulation after progestogen withdrawal. Ewes were assigned to two replicates of an experiment with the following treatments: 1) 3-mg norgestomet implant (i.e., one-half of a Syncro-Mate-B [SMB] implant) for 10 d, plus 2 mL of saline i.m. at SMB removal (n = 11); 2) 3-mg SMB implant for 10 d, plus 400 IU of eCG i.m. at SMB removal (n = 13); and 3) 3-mg SMB implant for 10 d, plus PIG. 600 i.m. at implant removal (n = 9). On d 6 after SMB insertion, PGF(2 alpha) was used to induce luteolysis. Beginning 12 h after implant removal, vasectomized rams were used at 12-h intervals to check for estrus. When a ewe was detected in estrus, each ovary was evaluated ultrasonically. Ovaries were evaluated again 16 h later and then at 8-h intervals until ovulation. Treatment altered the interval from implant removal to estrus (less [P < 0.05] in SMB + eCG than in the other two groups) and to ovulation (greatest [P < 0.05] in SMB). However, the treatment x replicate interaction was significant for the intervals from implant removal to estrus (P < 0.03) and from implant removal to ovulation (P < 0.05). An inconsistent response in the SMB-treated ewes seemed to be primarily responsible for the interaction. The intervals to estrus and to ovulation for the SMB-treated ewes were shorter (P < 0.05) in Replicate 1 than in Replicate 2. Also, both intervals seemed to be less consistent between replicates for the SMB + P.G. 600- than for the SMB + eCG-treated ewes that is, eCG seemed to increase the predictability of the intervals to estrus and to ovulation.

Knowing the times of ovulation in these stimulated animals is critical for accurate timing of insemination. To determine the timing of ovulation in ewes treated with Syncro-Mate-B (SMB) and FSH, ewes (n = 13) were implanted with SMB for 14 days and were treated with FSH twice daily for 4 days, starting on day I I after SMB implantation. Ewes underwent laparoscopy at 36, 48, and 60 h after SMB removal (day 0) to count corpora hemorrhagica (CH), followed by laparotomy on day 8 to count corpora lutea (CL). Blood samples were taken every 6 h to record plasma LH, estradiol-17beta, and progesterone concentrations on days 1-3, and one sample was collected before laparotomy on day 8. Ovulation rates (number of CH expressed as a percentage of the total number of CL) increased (P < 0.01) from 4 +/- 2% at 36 h, to 50 +/- 7% at 48 h, to 67 7% at 60 h. Between 36 and 48 h after SMB removal, 50% of the follicles had ovulated, and between 48 and 60 h another 16% of the follicles had ovulated. However, at 60 h after SMB removal, approximately 30% of the follicles still remained unovulated. Plasma LH concentrations increased (P < 0.05) from 1.4 ng/ml at 7:00 a.m. on day 1 to 10. 1 ng/ml at 1:00 a.m. on day 2 and then decreased (P < 0.05) to 0.6 ng/ml at the time of laparotomy (day 8). Plasma estradiol-17beta concentrations increased (P < 0.05) from 8.5 pg/ml at 7:00 a.m. on day 1 to 24.3 pg/ml at 7:00 p.m. on day 1 and then decreased (P < 0.05) to 8.6 pg/ml on day 8. Progesterone concentrations were very low (<0.2 ng/ml) on days 1-3, but increased (P < 0.01) to 4.3 ng/ml on day 8, after formation of the CL.

This logistic work requires engineers with experienced knowledge to identify machining processes from the CAD model provided by customers at the beginning, and later sourcing for qualified manufacturing suppliers according to identified manufacturing processes. Developing an efficient automatic Machining Process Identification (MPI) system becomes a pivotal problem for logistic automation. In this paper, a novel MPI system is presented based on 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Transfer learning. The proposed system admits triangularly tessellated surface (STL) models as inputs and outputs machining process labels (e.g. milling, turning etc.) as the results of classification of the neural network. Computer-synthesized workpiece models are utilized in training the neural network. In addition to the MPI system, a portable framework was developed for future applications in related fields. The MPI system shows more than 98% accuracy for both synthesized models and real workpiece models which verifies its robustness and real-time reliability. (c) 2020 The Authors.

In addition, product purity constraints are active at the optimal operating condition, which implies that these constraints can be easily violated by disturbance. Recently, artificial intelligence techniques have received significant attention for their ability to address complex problems, involving a large number of state variables. In this study, a data-based deep Q-network, which is a model-free reinforcement learning method, is applied to the SMB process to train a near-optimal control policy. Using a deep Q-network, the control policy of a complex dynamic system can be trained off-line as long as a sufficient number of data is provided. These data can be efficiently generated by performing numerical simulations in parallel on multiple machines. The on-line computation of the control input using a trained Q-network is fast enough to satisfy the computational time limit for the SMB process. However, because the Q-network does not predict the future state, it is not possible to explicitly impose state constraints. Instead, the state constraints are indirectly imposed by providing a relatively large penalty (negative reward) when the constraints are violate. Furthermore, logic-based switching control is utilized to limit the ranges of the extract and raffinate purities, which helps to satisfy the state constraints and reduce the regions in the state space for reinforcement learning to explore. The simulation results demonstrate the advantages of applying deep reinforcement learning to control the SMB process. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Excluded,10.1016/j.chroma.2021.462073,Deep neural network;Optimal control;Reinforcement learning;Simulated moving bed;Chromatography;Computer Simulation;Deep Learning;Algebra;Automation;Complex networks;Computation theory;Nonlinear equations;Partial differential equations;Process control;Reinforcement learning;Addition products;Discrete events;Neural-networks;Optimal controls;Partial differential-algebraic equations;Reinforcement learnings;Simulated moving bed process;Simulated movingbed (SMB);State constraints;System Dynamics;article;computer simulation;deep neural network;logic;punishment;reinforcement;reward;chromatography;computer simulation;procedures;Deep neural networks,,,,,False,"The article focuses on applying deep reinforcement learning to control a simulated moving bed process, which is unrelated to the use of AI/ML/DL/ANN in SMEs' operations or their organizational performance and competitiveness."

Smart manufacturing technologies (a part of the smart industry, an extension of Industry 4.0 initiatives and implementation) involve automating various processes. It aims to connect various units in real-time while enhancing profitability by reducing costs, increasing labour productivity, and improving overall efficiency. The impetus for our paper is the assumption that the adoption of smart manufacturing technologies such as advanced robotics, cyber-physical systems, or the Internet of Things (IoT) continues to be a challenge for Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) manufacturing firms in Singapore. Industry 4.0 adoption issues include significant capital investment, developing technical skills, recruiting new talent, re-skilling of the workforce, training needs, top management support, etc. But the traditional manufacturing model is fast evolving. Ultimately, adopting the right enabling technologies in a phased manner with proper planning remains a critical factor for the success of Industry 4.0 initiatives. This paper contributes to the minimal Asian management literature about Industry 4.0 matters in SMEs by interviewing eight key experts who are very knowledgeable about the subject matter. The qualitative study sheds light on the drivers and barriers to better understand current business dynamics, potential issues, focus areas, and initiatives to smoothen this implementation, to help catapult local manufacturers to the next level. A structured questionnaire was designed based on the current body of knowledge to conduct qualitative semi-structured interviews with key specialists and decision-makers across Government agencies, Institutes of Higher Learnings (IHL's), suppliers/providers of Industry 4.0 technology, business associations, and the SME sector. The analysis of the interviews suggests that factors or drivers such as technology push by the Government with robust funding and training support, skilled labour shortages including imported labour dependence, productivity and efficiency issues, the pressure to innovate business models due to increased competition, and the impact of Covid-19 are propelling SMEs to adopt Industry 4.0. Some of the barriers include high investment costs and return on investment concerns, capability concerns, mindset issues, and lack of ecosystem concerns.

The in-hole velocity of detonation (VoD) of non-ideal explosive also boosts up with the increase in diameter till the optimum diameter is reached. The increase in the energy content and in-hole VoD cause a sizable effect on the rock fragmentation. The effect can be assessed by counting the number of oversize boulders.

The results from ANFO blasts indicated that there was no significant variation in the number of oversize boulders with the diameter whereas a perceptible variation was noticed in case of SME blasts with the change in the diameter. The change in the number of oversize boulders in ANFO blasts was negligible because mean energy factor remained almost same even when the diameter of the blast holes was altered.

However, small and medium enterprises (SMEs) are showing prominent gaps in this adoption due to their level of awareness and knowledge towards cyber security and the security mindset. This is due to their priority of running their businesses over requiring using the right technology in protecting their data. This study explored how SMEs in Wales are handling cybercrime and managing their daily online activities the best they can, in keeping their data safe in tackling cyber threats. The sample collected consisted of 122 Welsh SME respondents in a collection of data through a survey questionnaire. The results and findings showed that there were large gaps in the awareness and knowledge of using intelligent software, in particular the uses of machine learning integration within their technology to track and combat complex cybercrime that perhaps would have been missed by standard cyber security software packages. The study’s findings showed that only 30% of the sampled SMEs understood the terminology of cyber security. The awareness of machine learning and its algorithms was also questioned in the implementation of their cyber security software packages. The study further highlighted that Welsh SMEs were unaware of what this software could do to protect their data. The findings in this paper also showed that various elements such as education and the size of SME made an impact on their choices for the right software packages being implemented, compared to elements such as age, gender, role and being a decision maker, having no impact on these choices.

Given their functional heterogeneity, Kv7 channels represent important pharmacological targets for the development of new drugs for neuronal, cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. Objective: In the present manuscript, we focus on describing the pharmacological relevance and potential therapeutic applications of drugs acting on neuronally-expressed Kv7.2/3 channels, placing particular emphasis on the different chemotypes, and highlighting their pharmacodynamic and, whenever possible, pharmacokinetic peculiarities. Methods: The present work is based on an in-depth search of the currently available scientific literature, and on our own experience and knowledge in the field of neuronal Kv7 channel pharmacology. Space limitations impeded to describe the full pharmacological potential of Kv7 channels; thus, we have chosen to focus on neuronal channels composed of Kv7.2 and Kv7.3 subunits, and to mainly concentrate on their involvement in epilepsy. Results: An astonishing heterogeneity in the molecular scaffolds exploitable to develop Kv7.2/3 modulators is evident, with important structural/functional peculiarities of distinct compound classes.

""Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution"" (TOPSIS) is a distance-based multi-criteria decisionmaking tool that considers both ideal and negative-ideal solutions within its feasible solution domain. In reality, ideal solution is not attainable. Therefore, TOPSIS considers the shortest Euclidean distance from the ideal solution to have a composite of the best performance values exhibited by a candidate-alternative for each of the criteria. However, TOPSIS does not have provision to allow cross-functional planning criteria evolved from the multi-functional teams of SMEs. At this juncture, Quality Function Deployment (QFD), an existing cross-functional planning technique, is suitable integrated with TOPSIS for latter's better flexibility. The proposed methodology is validated using a benchmark problem from the literature. As an example, ten candidatesuppliers are ranked using the developed methodology considering eight disparate criteria and cost factors.

The aim of this study is to give insight into safety risks in grain handling facilities through information processing of workers' compensation data on agro-manufacturing occupational incidents within commercial grain elevators in the Midwest region of the United States between 2008 and 2016. The severity of occupational incidents is determined by total dollar amount incurred on medical, indemnity, and other expenses in workers' compensation claims. The most important factors that affect the cost escalation of occupational incidents are extracted using bootstrap partitioning method, and are applied as input for constructing two machine learning models: random forests decision trees, and na ve Bayes. Both models show high accuracy (87.64% and 92.78% respectively) in predicting that a future claim is classified as either low or medium, severity. The models contribute to identifying high injury risk groups, and prevalent incident causes, allowing a more research -based focused intervention effort in grain handling workplaces. In addition, the results are applicable in forecasting cost severity of future claims, and identifying factors that contribute to the escalation of claims costs. (c) 2020 The Authors.

METHODS In a prospective, single-center, proof-of-concept study, 12 cadaveric porcine skin samples were injected with CaHA (0.4-0.8 mL). Samples were then randomized to intralesional injection of 0.2-mL sodium thiosulfate (STS, 12.5 g/50 mL); 1 to 2 g of topical sodium metabisulfite (SMB, 25% SMB in 120-mL gel) applied with occlusion, or both intralesional STS and topical SMB. Control samples were not treated after CaHA injection. A 4-mm punch biopsy was obtained 24 hours after treatment, and tissue sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and prepared for light microscopy. A board-certified dermatopathologist estimated the amount of CaHA present in each sample.        RESULTS Intralesional STS alone or combined with topical SMB completely dissolved CaHA in the porcine skin samples.

However, predicting and identifying the behavior of collaborative robots remains a challenging problem due to the significant non-linear properties of their unique gearbox, the harmonic drive. To tackle the engineering problem, this work proposes a physics-informed neural network (PINN) to predict and identify collaborative robot joint dynamics. The procedure involves deriving the state-space dynamic model, embedding the system's dynamics into a recurrent neural network (RNN) with customized Runge-Kutta cells, obtaining labeled training data, predicting system responses, and estimating dynamic parameters. The proposed method is applied to predict and identify collaborative robot joint dynamics, and the results are verified and validated through numerical simulations and experimental testing, respectively. The obtained results demonstrate a high level of agreement with the ground truth and exhibit superior performance compared to the conventional PINN and the non-linear grey-box state-space estimation algorithm when confronted with non-linearity and dynamic coupling.

Besides costs for the cutting tools themselves, further costs appear - equipment downtime for tool changes, reworking of damaged surfaces, scrap parts or damages to the machine tool itself in the worst case. Consequently, tools need to be exchanged on a regular basis or at a defined tool wear state. In order to detect and monitor the tool wear state different approaches are possible. In this publication, a deep learning approach for image processing is investigated in order to quantify the tool wear state. In a first step, a Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) is trained for cutting tool type classification. This works well with an accuracy of 95.6% on the test dataset. Finally, a Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) for semantic segmentation is trained on individual tool type datasets (ball end mill, end mill, drills and inserts) and a mixed dataset to detect worn areas on the microscopic tool images. The accuracy metric for this kind of task, Intersect over Union (IoU), is around 0.7 for all networks on the test dataset. This paper contributes to the perspective of a fully automated cutting tool wear analysis method using machine tool integrated microscopes in the scientific and industrial environment.

This study proposes a novel hybrid ensemble machine learning approach to forecast the credit risk associated with SMEs' agriculture 4.0 investments in SCF. Two core approaches were used, i.e., Rotation Forest algorithm and Logit Boosting algorithm. Key variables influencing the credit risk of agriculture 4.0 investments in SMEs were identified and evaluated using data collected from 216 agricultural SMEs, 195 Leading Enterprises and 104 FSPs operating in African agriculture sector. Besides the classical measures of credit risk assessment without involving SCF, the findings indicate that current ratio, financial leverage, profit margin on sales and growth rate of the agricultural SME are the upmost important variables that SCF actors need to focus on, in order to accurately and optimistically forecast and alleviate credit risk. The output of our study provides useful guidelines for SMEs, as it highlights the conditions under which they would be seen as creditworthy by FSPs. On the other hand, this study encourages the wide application of SCF in financing agriculture 4.0 investments.

Since wear in these processes not only causes unplanned downtime but also directly affects product quality, inline detection of wear and its effect on product quality is of major importance. However, current quality assurance (QA) methods are limited to manual offline inspection by operators at predefined intervals, so that 100% inspection of the product and description of the state of wear is not found in industrial practice. The aim of this work is therefore to develop an optical system that enables in-line acquisition of product images and the associated control of blanking-specific quality features up to stroke rates of 300 strokes per minute (spm). In order to make the system attractive to small- and medium-sized enterprises (SME), the system is designed to minimize integration and investment costs using commercially available components. By combining the system with a methodology for extracting blanking-specific features, so-called key performance parameters (KPPs), the condition of the blanked surface as a relevant quality parameter is derived directly from the workpiece image. To demonstrate the transferability of the methodology to industrial applications, two use cases are investigated. In the first case, the KPPs are used directly to determine the quality of the blanked workpiece and are compared with reference measurements. Here, the KPPs are quantified with a mean absolute error of 18 mu m compared to a ground truth. In the second case, the KPPs are used to build a machine learning (ML) model to estimate the wear of the blanking tool.

To this end, the machine learning model can be regarded as a potential substitution to accelerate the optimization process.        RESULTS: Several machine learning algorithms were applied to predict the product purities under various operation conditions using two SMB processes as case studies: i.e., a sugar separation of rebaudioside A and stevioside, as well as an enantioseparation of 1,1 '-bi-2-naphthol racemate. The results indicate that the random forest (RF) model and the deep neural network (DNN) model provide a satisfactory accuracy with a mean absolute error (MAE) lower than 0.19% (RF) and 0.08% (DNN), respectively. During the optimization process to maximize the feed flowrate under specific purity requirements, among the two selected models, DNN model showed a better generalization ability than RF model and gave a feed flowrate 10% higher than the highest value in the training dataset, which was consistent with the result obtained by using the mechanistic model. The optimized operation conditions for sugar separation were verified experimentally and the achieved purities of rebaudioside A and stevioside were 99.2% and 98.8%, respectively.

The degradation of the cutting wheel significantly affects the LCD panel quality. Currently, there is few effective approaches that can detect the degradation of the cutting wheel at the working station for health monitoring purpose, due to the small size of the component and the complex manufacturing operation. That leads to high economic costs in the production lines in the real industries. In order to address this issue, this paper presents a deep convolutional neural network-based method for defect detection of the cutting wheels using the industrial images. An end-to-end health monitoring system is built based on machine vision, which directly takes the raw images as inputs, and outputs the detection results. That facilitates the industrial applications since little prior knowledge on image processing and fault detection is required. The experiments on a real -world cutting wheel degradation dataset are carried out for validation. High fault diagnosis testing accuracies are obtained, that indicates the proposed method offers an effective and promising approach for the cutting wheel health monitoring problem.

Distribution system growth is multigenerational and often leads to mixed assets in the same area where transmission pipeline segments are often constructed within shorter time frames and more uniform materials. Slow, sporadic growth leads to varied record availability and quality that might not readily support commercially available risk models. The project described in this paper was initiated to develop predictive methods to prioritize mitigation and replacement activities for distribution networks. Priority is assigned to areas by risk, equipment characteristics and environmental attributes.        In a previous IPC paper, the authors developed a historicalbased predictive model but applied it to a single city area. This work has been extended to cover the entire province of Saskatchewan. The model relies on logistic regression and a machine learning algorithm to associate the historical failure rate with the asset type, age, pipe material, diameter, pressure, and an array of geographical-dependent attributes such as soil properties and climate events. The output of the model allows integrity engineers to consider predicted failure rates to complement the lagging performance indicators used to develop integrity program planning. This model demonstrates the advantage of using available distribution system records to develop a custom historicalbased predictive model.        Consequence estimates for distribution networks are also described. Distribution leaks are often classified into hazard levels that differentiate operational response.

However, its process performances were restricted by the occurrence of a significant discrepancy between the adsorption behaviors of BD isomers (meso-BD and DL-BD) along the SMB columns. To address such concern, this study aimed to explore an effective adsorbent in preventing the problem of BD isomerism along a chromatographic bed, which was then attempted to be utilized in developing a substantially improved SMB for acetoin-BD separation. It was found first that an adsorbent with less pi bonds could be effective in minimizing the extent of BD isomerism and further in improving the performances of the acetoin-BD separation SMB to a marked degree. Using such a properly selected adsorbent, the adsorption parameters of acetoin and BD isomers were determined from multiple-frontal-analysis experimental data and the SMB experimental data respectively. On the basis of their resultant parameter values, the considered SMB was optimally designed and then experimentally tested, which revealed that the designed SMB could allow 44% higher throughput and 44% lower desorbent usage while keeping higher purities and lower losses, compared to the previous SMB. Furthermore, the developed SMB in this study was operated at room temperature, indicating its superiority over the previous SMB operated at 60 degrees C in energy efficiency.",Excluded,10.1016/j.seppur.2020.116922     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),"Simulated moving bed;2,3-Butanediol isomerism;Amberchrom-CG71C;Acetoin;Performance improvement;STANDING-WAVE DESIGN;SERRATIA-MARCESCENS H32;MULTIOBJECTIVE OPTIMIZATION;RECOVERY;ENANTIOMERS;DIFFUSION;REACTOR;FUCOSE;SMB",,,,,False,"The article focuses on chemical separation processes and adsorbent materials, not on the use of AI, ML, DL, ANN, or NN in SMEs' operations."

There are, however, only few studies that develop credit coring models for SME lending. The objective of this study is to introduce a novel, more accurate credit risk estimation approach for SMEs business lending. Based on traditional statistical methods and recent artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, we proposed a hybrid model which combines the logistic regression approach and artificial neural networks (ANN). In order to test the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed hybrid model, we use the data of Finnish SMEs from the fiscal years 2004 to 2012. Our results suggest that the proposed ANN/logistic hybrid model is more accurate than either of the initial models ANN or logistic regression. This improvement in the accuracy of the credit scoring model decreases evaluation errors and has thereby many potential practical implications. First of all, a more accurate credit scoring model can result in better performance of the whole SME loan portfolio. Second, it can also result in lower capital requirements from the banks perspective and lower interest rates from the individual firm's perspective.

As the digital transformation redefines business, digitization (Digitization) represents a special challenge for businesses in general and for small and medium sized companies (SMEs) in particular. This paper will provide for an insight into and the premise for an upcoming study regarding the awareness, readiness and the capability of German SME to meet this challenge by taking into account their operational processes. It will also introduce the reader to the issues German SMEs deal with when preparing to join the wave of Digitization, Big Data Analytics (BDA), Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI). The research presented in this paper was undertaken in order to answer the question whether German SMEs are ready for the upcoming challenges and the competition in the worldwide market. A first sign of the heavy interest for Digitization from the SME market was revealed during a short telephone interview which initiated the idea for a survey. The survey showed that nearly all queried SMEs are interested in the subject of Digitization, BDA, ML and/or AI and are willing to implement these innovative facilitators in their (daily) business models through e.g. bots and/or voice-operated machines. Nevertheless, even if there is the will in the market for the implementation of these innovations, it seems as if it – for a high proportion of German SMEs – will not be possible, due to insufficient funds, lack of work force and/or work culture to fully reap the benefits or even lay the fundament of these innovations. The survey also brought to light that, in terms of a company’s readiness, there is a huge disparity on a cross-departmental level in one and the same SME; while the marketing department might e.g. be ready and set-up with all necessary systems and datasets, the production department is not at all or vice versa.

First, a State-Supervised Variational Autoencoder (SS-VAE) model is introduced, which integrates the learning process of turbine operational states into the VAE bypass, enabling it to capture variations in vibration signal data across different operating conditions. Through the fusion decoding of operating states and vibration signals, the foundation of the SS-VAE model and its loss function is established. Secondly, a new State Mapping Error (SME) index is introduced to further address the issue of reconstruction error variability across multiple conditions. The proposed method is validated through a blade fault test rig and applied in an industrial gas turbine blade fault case.

Another important driver is digitalization and the associated increase in the volume of data. These data, from a multitude of devices and systems, offer enormous potential, which increases the need for intelligent, dynamic analysis models even in smaller companies. This article presents the results of an investigation into whether and to what extent machine learning processes can contribute to optimizing energy consumption and reducing incorrectly produced plastic parts in plastic processing SMEs. For this purpose, the machine data were recorded in a plastics-producing company for the automotive industry and analyzed with regard to the material and energy flows. Machine learning methods were used to train these data in order to uncover optimization potential. Another problem that was addressed in the project was the analysis of manufacturing processes characterized by strong non-linearities and time-invariant behavior with Big Data methods and self-learning controls. Machine learning is suitable for this if sufficient training data are available. Due to the high material throughput in the production of the SMEs’ plastic parts, these requirements for the development of suitable learning methods were met. In response to the increasing importance of current information technologies in industrial production processes, the project aimed to use these technologies for sustainable digitalization in order to reduce the industry’s environmental impact and increase efficiency. © 2021 by the authors.

There must be a general strategy used to transform raw signals into useful features, but representing this generalization in the context of our information extraction tool set is lacking.

However, the experience of Machine Learning (ML) and information communities has not been generalized into an intuitive framework that is useful to researchers across disciplines. The data exploration phase of data mining is a prime example of this unspoken, ad-hoc nature of ML - the Computer Scientist works with a Subject Matter Expert (SME) to understand the data, and then build tools (i.e. classifiers, etc.) which can benefit the SME and the rest of the researchers in that field. We ask, why is there not a tool to represent information in a meaningful way to the researcher asking the question?

SMEs in these developed countries have created their own cyber regimes around AI and ML. This knowledge is tested daily in how these countries’ SMEs run their businesses and identify threats and attacks, based on the support structure of the individual country. Based on recent changes to the UK General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Brexit, and ISO standards requirements, machine learning cybersecurity (MLCS) adoption in the UK SME market has become prevalent and a good example to lean on, amongst other developed nations. Whilst MLCS has been successfully applied in many applications, including network intrusion detection systems (NIDs) worldwide, there is still a gap in the rate of adoption of MLCS techniques for UK SMEs. Other developed countries such as Spain and Australia also fall into this category, and similarities and differences to MLCS adoptions are discussed. Applications of how MLCS is applied within these SME industries are also explored. The paper investigates, using quantitative and qualitative methods, the challenges to adopting MLCS in the SME ecosystem, and how operations are managed to promote business growth. Much like security guards and policing in the real world, the virtual world is now calling on MLCS techniques to be embedded like secret service covert operations to protect data being distributed by the millions into cyberspace. This paper will use existing global research from multiple disciplines to identify gaps and opportunities for UK SME small business cyber security. This paper will also highlight barriers and reasons for low adoption rates of MLCS in SMEs and compare success stories of larger companies implementing MLCS. The methodology uses structured quantitative and qualitative survey questionnaires, distributed across an extensive participation pool directed to the SMEs’ management and technical and non-technical professionals using stratify methods. Based on the analysis and findings, this study reveals that from the primary data obtained, SMEs have the appropriate cybersecurity packages in place but are not fully aware of their potential. Secondary data collection was run in parallel to better understand how these barriers and challenges emerged, and why the rate of adoption of MLCS was very low. The paper draws the conclusion that help through government policies and processes coupled together with collaboration could minimize cyber threats in combatting hackers and malicious actors in trying to stay ahead of the game. These aspirations can be reached by ensuring that those involved have been well trained and understand the importance of communication when applying appropriate safety processes and procedures. This paper also highlights important funding gaps that could help raise cyber security awareness in the form of grants, subsidies, and financial assistance through various public sector policies and training. Lastly, SMEs’ lack of understanding of risks and impacts of cybercrime could lead to conflicting messages between cross-company IT and cybersecurity rules. Trying to find the right balance between this risk and impact, versus productivity impact and costs, could lead to UK SMES getting over these hurdles in this cyberspace in the quest for promoting the usage of MLCS. UK and Wales governments can use the research conducted in this paper to inform and adapt their policies to help UK SMEs become more secure from cyber-attacks and compare them to other developed countries also on the same future path. © 2021 by the authors.

The evolution in class A beta-lactamases occurs through optimisation of their dynamic phenotypes at different timescales. At long-timescales, certain conformations are more catalytically permissive than others while at the short timescales, fine-grained optimisation of free energy barriers can improve efficiency in ligand processing by the active site. Free energy barriers, which define all coordinated movements, depend on the flexibility of the secondary structural elements. The most highly conserved residues in class A beta-lactamases are hydrophobic nodes that stabilize the core. To assess how the stable hydrophobic core is linked to the structural dynamics of the active site, we carried out adaptively sampled molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in four representative class A beta-lactamases (KPC-2, SME-1, TEM-1, and SHV-1). Using Markov State Models (MSM) and unsupervised deep learning, we show that the dynamics of the hydrophobic nodes is used as a metastable relay of kinetic information within the core and is coupled with the catalytically permissive conformation of the active site environment.

Thus, there is a need of providing SMEs with affordable, intelligent security systems with the ability of detecting and recovering from the most detrimental attacks. In this paper, we propose an intelligent cybersecurity platform, which has been designed with the objective of helping SMEs to make their systems and network more secure. The aim of this platform is to provide a solution optimizing detection and recovery from attacks. To do this, we propose the application of proactive security techniques in combination with both Machine Learning (ML) and blockchain. Our proposal is enclosed in the IASEC project, which allows providing security in each of the phases of an attack. Like this, we help SMEs in prevention, avoiding systems and network from being attacked; detection, identifying when there is something potentially harmful for the systems; containment, trying to stop the effects of an attack; and response, helping to recover the systems to a normal state. © 2020, Universidad Internacional de la Rioja.

To address this issue, we aimed to develop a highly-efficient simulated-moving-bed (SMB) process for the continuous-mode separation of acetoin from BD with high purity and small loss. As a first step for this task, the adsorption and mass-transfer parameters of acetoin and BD on a proven adsorbent were estimated while assuming that BD isomers (meso-BD and DL-BD) would be identical in adsorption and mass-transfer behaviors. The resultant parameters from such estimation were applied to the optimal design of the acetoin-BD separation SMB. The designed SMB was then experimentally investigated, which revealed that some sign of BD isomerism occurred in the SMB column-profile data and thus had an adverse effect on the SMB separation performance. To resolve this problem, the individual parameters of BD isomers were determined on the basis of the SMB column-profile data and an inverse-method principle. The resulting parameters of BD isomers were used in the re-design of the target SMB, which was then experimentally checked for its separation performance. It was confirmed that such SMB re-designed in consideration of BD isomerism was quite effective in the continuous-mode separation of acetoin from BD with high purity (> 99.2%) and small loss (< 1.52%).

It is recognized to be one of the basic operations required by the process of data and schema integration and its outcome serves in many tasks such as targeted content delivery and view integration. Schema matching research has been going on for more than 25 years now. An interesting research topic, that was largely left untouched involves the automatic selection of schema matchers to an ensemble, a set of schema matchers. To the best of our knowledge, none of the existing algorithmic solutions offer such a selection feature. In this paper we provide a thorough investigation of this research topic. We introduce a new heuristic, Schema Matcher Boosting (SMB). We show that SMB has the ability to choose among schema matchers and to tune their importance. As such, SMB introduces a new promise for schema matcher designers. Instead of trying to design a perfect schema matcher, a designer can instead focus on finding better than random schema matchers. For the effective utilization of SMB, we propose a complementary approach to the design of new schema matchers. We separate schema matchers into first-line and second-line matchers. First-line schema matchers were designed by-and-large as applications of existing works in other areas (e.g., machine learning and information retrieval) to schemata. Second-line schema matchers operate on the outcome of other schema matchers to improve their original outcome. SMB selects matcher pairs, where each pair contains a first-line matcher and a second-line matcher. We run a thorough set of experiments to analyze SMB ability to effectively choose schema matchers and show that SMB performs better than other, state-of-the-art ensemble matchers.

One example is in the production of pharmaceuticals, in which, typically, isomer properties related to different effects are found: one enantiomer may kill while the other may cure. Thus, strict quality control is necessary in this field, which requires accurate, reliable and frequent measurements of the system. However, the measurement of the main quality properties associated with the production of some pharmaceuticals has a low frequency. Consequently, in addition to safety-related issues, financial losses are also related to these low frequency of measurements, as the product can easily run towards an out of spec production. In this scenario, the present work proposes a novel Deep Artificial Intelligence structure, which has an intrinsic (Nonlinear Output Error) NOE structure, associated with a (Nonlinear AutoRegressive with Exogenous input) NARX predictor, to be used as an online soft sensor in order to provide information about the main properties of a Simulated Moving Bed chromatographic unit, commonly used in the production of pharmaceuticals, in order to mitigate the low frequency of measurement associated with this unit.

The model can adapt itself as the process evolves, having the possibility of online learning through measurements obtained in the laboratory periodically.

Indeed, SMEs are aware of the need to digitalize-more than one in two SMEs are concerned that they may lose competitiveness if they do not adopt new digital technologies.

Some decision-makers renounce digital transition simply because they do not understand how it can be incorporated into the business.

A requirement that has been recommended by several international organizations such as the European Union, especially because SMEs contribute significantly to job creation and added value and to overcoming the effects of economic crises. Despite the progress in this field, there are economies that have been little or poorly addressed by the literature. This is the case for Spain, an economy where SMEs account for a significant share of its business landscape.

From a practical standpoint, the idea of utilizing a subject matter expert SME) as a basis for judgment on a design's manufacturability early in the design process lacks feasibility due to the inability to efficiently and effectively evaluate a large tradespace of unique design alternatives. The practice of Design for Manufacturing (DFM) analysis typically involves having access to design geometry and specifications with some consideration of the manufacturing processes. However, in the conceptual stage, the challenge involves assessing manufacturability based on a significant number of unknown parameters and doing so in a manner which is nonsubjective. Furthermore, evaluation of early stage product designs has significant influence on program cost. So, how can programs realize the impact of design options that may influence manufacturability and relate this back to a common frame of reference (i.e., cost, schedule, risk)? A research challenge includes determining how to harness the knowledge that is used to determine manufacturability from both factual and heuristic-based approaches, which requires some knowledge of the design parameters and the decision-making involved with assessing manufacturability. There are different ways to explore this area of research, but one possible approach rests in the exploration of artificial intelligence and how it can be applied in the area of manufacturability assessments. There are various subsets of artificial intelligence; some involve areas such as rule-based engines and systems, knowledge graphs, and expert systems, while others explore more complex areas such as machine learning and neural networks. The choice on which path to take requires some exploration into these possibilities and an understanding of the design data available in premilestone A and how feature-based information can be used to create an objective-based manufacturability assessment.

These rates are obtained especially when these algorithms are fine-tuned for the application at hand.

We propose an alternative approach to stochastic line search by using a new algorithm based on forward step model building. This model building step incorporates second-order information that allows adjusting not only the step length but also the search direction. Noting that deep learning model parameters come in groups (layers of tensors), our method builds its model and calculates a new step for each parameter group. This novel diagonalization approach makes the selected step lengths adaptive. We provide convergence rate analysis, and experimentally show that the proposed algorithm achieves faster convergence and better generalization in well-known test problems.

The management goal required that cows have a minimum BCS of 5 and be at least 36 d postpartum (PP) at treatment onset. However, final results included 23 cows (8.4%) whose BCS fell below 5. In Exp. 2, 286 pubertal beef heifers were stratified by BW and BCS and allocated randomly to the three treatments. Heifers were predominantly Brahman crossbred (n = 265; Brahman x Hereford, F-1; Santa Cruz) or purebred Brahman-influenced (Santa Gertrudis) with a smaller number (n = 21) of Hereford heifers also included. For both experiments, SMB treatment consisted of a 9-d norgestomet ear implant plus an estradiol valerate/norgestomet injection on d 0. Norgestomet-prostaglandin-treated females were implanted with a SMB implant without the estradiol valerate/norgestomet injection at the time of implant insertion and received 25 mg prostaglandin F-2alpha (PGF) i.m. 2 d before implant removal. Ovsynch consisted of 100 mug GnRH i.m. on d 1, 25 mg PGF i.m. on d 8, and a second GnRH injection on d 10. Beginning on d 9, calves were removed for 48 h in Exp. 1. Cattle in SMB and NP groups in both experiments were timed-inseminated 48 to 54 h after implant removal and at 12 to 24 h after the second GnRH injection (Ovsynch). Timed AI conception rates did not differ between the SMB (45.1%) and Ovsynch (42.4%) groups; however, conception rate in the NP group tended (P < 0.12) to be lower overall than in the other groups due to a reduced (P < 0.05) conception rate in cows that were < 60 d PP at treatment onset. Conversely, timed-AI conception was greatest (P < 0.056) in NP (54.7%) compared with SMB (40.4%) and Ovsynch (39.1%) for heifers in Exp. 2. We conclude that in mature, suckled beef cows with Brahman genetic influence, SMB and Ovsynch perform similarly when cow eligibility relies primarily on BCS and minimum days PP. The NP treatment results in lower conception in cows < 60 d PP compared with SMB and Ovsynch.

Ransomware is a kind of malware that is the main threat to digital extortion and has caused many organizations to lose huge revenue by paying much bigger ransom demands to the cybercriminals in recent years. The explosive growth of ransomware is due to the existing large infection vector such as social engineering, email attachment, zip file download, browsing malicious site, infected search engine which are boosted dramatically by easily available cryptographic tools, Ransomware As a Service (RaaS), increased cloud storage and off-the-self ransomware toolkits. The large infection vector and available toolkits not only grew ransomware extremely, but also made them more obfuscated, encrypted and varying patterns in the new variants. This, in turn, caused the conventional supervised analysis and detection engine to fail to detect the new variants of ransomware. This paper addresses the limitations of conventional supervised detection engine and proposes semi-supervised framework to compute the inherent latent sources of the varying patterns in the new variants in an unsupervised way using deep learning approaches.

With the digital transformation being one of the most discussed topics in the business world today, many decision makers - especially of small and medium sized enterprises - find themselves struggling with the understanding of new digital technologies and thus the potential benefits and risks for their companies. New technologies like the Internet of Things, Blockchain or Artificial Intelligence have great potential for businesses. However, carefully evaluating and selecting purposeful technologies - aligned to the digital strategy - is a major key to success. Technologies appear, change and also vanish so rapidly in the digital age, that a proper understanding is crucial for a sustainable technological foundation. Due to a lack of expertise and functions being less segregated in small and medium sized enterprises, in most cases the company owners are forced to gain a certain level of technology knowledge in order to be able to make well-founded decisions with respect to their digital roadmaps and thus the technological base of their companies.        Focusing on a digital way of knowledge transfer, the presented study examines the impact of serious games in the business context. Based on a state-of-the-art literature research, the application of serious games in diverse fields as well as the success factors are evaluated.

However, little is known about how tourists use social media for travel planning and what factors influence their intentions to use social media for this purpose. This thesis aims to understand tourists’ intentions to use social media for travel planning. Specifically, it investigates the factors influencing tourists’ intentions to use social media for planning travel to Saudi Arabia. It develops a machine learning (ML) classification model to assist Saudi tourism SMEs in creating effective digital marketing strategies for social media platforms. A survey was conducted with 573 tourists interested in visiting Saudi Arabia, using the Design Science Research (DSR) approach. The findings support the tourist-based theoretical framework, showing that perceived usefulness (PU), perceived ease of use (PEOU), satisfaction (SAT), marketing-generated content (MGC), and user-generated content (UGC) significantly impact tourists’ intentions to use social media for travel planning. Tourists’ characteristics and visit characteristics influenced their intentions to use MGC but not UGC. The tourist-based ML classification model, developed using the LinearSVC algorithm, achieved an accuracy of 99% when evaluated using the K-Fold Cross-Validation (KF-CV) technique. The findings of this study have several implications for Saudi tourism SMEs. First, the results suggest that SMEs should focus on developing social media content that is perceived as useful, easy to use, and satisfying. Second, the findings suggest that SMEs should focus on using MGC in their social media marketing campaigns. Third, the results suggest that SMEs should tailor their social media marketing campaigns to the characteristics of their target tourists. This study contributes to the literature on tourism marketing and social media by providing a better understanding of how tourists use social media for travel planning.

In this paper, we propose Securitas, a network trace-based protocol identification system, which exploits the semantic information in protocol message formats. Securitas requires no prior knowledge of protocol specifications. Deeming a protocol as a language between two processes, our approach is based upon the new insight that the n-grams of protocol traces, just like those of natural languages, exhibit highly skewed frequency-rank distribution that can be leveraged in the context of protocol identification. In Securitas, we first extract the statistical protocol message formats by clustering n-grams with the same semantics, and then use the corresponding statistical formats to classify raw network traces. Our tool involves the following key features: 1) applicable to both connection oriented protocols and connection less protocols; 2) suitable for both text and binary protocols; 3) no need to assemble IP packets into TCP or UDP flows; and 4) effective for both long-live flows and short-live flows. We implement Securitas and conduct extensive evaluations on real-world network traces containing both textual and binary protocols. Our experimental results on BitTorrent, CIFS/SMB, DNS, FTP, PPLIVE, SIP, and SMTP traces show that Securitas has the ability to accurately identify the network traces of the target application protocol with an average recall of about 97.4% and an average precision of about 98.4%.

The empirical evidence collected from interviews with key stakeholders, practitioners’ forums, and public company documents yields two distinct approaches that differ in their potential for accelerating innovation and reducing the concept-product gap. From a contingency perspective, these two approaches are expanded into four distinct development process configurations, contingent on the business development stage, reliance on 3rd party platforms, availability of high volumes of data, investment level, organisational agility, and level of novelty. The resulting process typology could be used as a diagnostic tool for FinTech SMEs interested in effectively leveraging AI innovation. Using contingency theory, we further develop these insights into a new theoretical framework to explain how AI innovation development unfolds in FinTech SMEs and the rationale for different implementations. Our new process typology and theoretical model can help researchers investigate the mechanisms underlying technological innovation processes. We further identify the specific reasons why the potential of AI for creating new services and disrupting incumbents via digital startups has not been fully realised even in contexts with significant investment and support from public and private business development programmes.

Data indicate these decreases are due, in part, to retention of a functional corpus luteum(CL). Our objective was to determine whether PGF2 alpha administered in conjunction with SMB would improve estrous response and pregnancy rates in metestrous cows with no detrimental effects to cows in other stages of the estrous cycle. Three hundred seventy-three suckled beef cows were observed for estrus for 21 d before SMB administration to determine stage of an estrous cycle. Blood samples were collected 14 and 7 d before treatment and at SMB administration. Serum was assayed for concentration of progesterone to verify stage of estrous cycle or noncyclicity. All cows received the standard SMB regime and were allotted by age and stage of cycle to one of two groups. Cows denoted SMB + L received 25 mg of PGF2 alpha 8 d after implantation, whereas cows denoted SMB served as controls. On Day 10, SMB implants were removed and females were observed for subsequent estrus. At this time, calves were removed from their dams for 48 h. Artificial insemination was performed 12 hr after observation of a standing estrus. Timed insemination was performed at 48 hr after implant removal for cows not inseminated at 24 or 36 hr after implant removal. Interval to synchronized estrus (within 5 d of implant removal) was lengthened for metestrous cows compared to cows in other stages of the cycle irrespective of treatment (P < 0.001).

With an increase in more wired and wireless connections and devices on SME networks, unpredictable malicious activities and interruptions have risen. Finding the harmony between the advancement of technology and costs has always been a balancing act particularly in convincing the finance directors of these SMEs to invest in capital towards their IT infrastructure. This paper looks at various devices that currently are in the market to detect intrusions and look at how these devices handle prevention strategies for SMEs in their working environment both at home and in the office, in terms of their credibility in handling zero-day attacks against the costs of achieving so. The experiment was set up during the 2020 pandemic referred to as COVID-19 when the world experienced an unprecedented event of large scale. The operational working environment of SMEs reflected the context when the UK went into lockdown. Pre-pandemic would have seen this experiment take full control within an operational office environment; however, COVID-19 times has pushed us into a corner to evaluate every aspect of cybersecurity from the office and keeping the data safe within the home environment. The devices chosen for this experiment were OpenSource such as SNORT and pfSense to detect activities within the home environment, and Cisco, a commercial device, set up within an SME network. All three devices operated in a live environment within the SME network structure with employees being both at home and in the office. All three devices were observed from the rules they displayed, their costs and machine learning techniques integrated within them. The results revealed these aspects to be important in how they identified zero-day attacks. The findings showed that OpenSource devices whilst free to download, required a high level of expertise in personnel to implement and embed machine learning rules into the business solution even for staff working from home. However, when using Cisco, the price reflected the buy-in into this expertise and Cisco’s mainframe network, to give up-to-date information on cyber-attacks. The requirements of the UK General Data Protection Regulations Act (GDPR) were also acknowledged as part of the broader framework of the study. Machine learning techniques such as anomaly-based intrusions did show better detection through a commercially subscription-based model for support from Cisco compared to that of the OpenSource model which required internal expertise in machine learning. A cost model was used to compare the outcome of SMEs’ decision making, in getting the right framework in place in securing their data. In conclusion, finding a balance between IT expertise and costs of products that are able to help SMEs protect and secure their data will benefit the SMEs from using a more intelligent controlled environment with applied machine learning techniques, and not compromising on costs. © 2021 by the authors.",,10.3390/fi13080186,Artificial intelligence;Cyber threat;Cybersecurity;Detection;Intrusion;Intrusion detection;Machine learning;Network intrusion;OpenSource;Prevention;Balancing;Decision making;Investments;Network security;Personnel;Privacy by design;Applied machine learning;Controlled environment;General data protection regulations;Machine learning techniques;Malicious activities;Prevention strategies;Small and medium enterprise;Small medium enterprise;Machine learning,,,,,True,"The article discusses the use of machine learning techniques in cybersecurity devices adopted by SMEs, highlighting benefits and challenges, which aligns with the research focus on AI/ML adoption in SME operations and its impact on organizational performance."

While large listed companies are mandated to disclose ESG information, the same cannot be said for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). SMEs are not obligated to provide either sustainability information or their own ESG ratings, leaving them susceptible to potential disadvantages in securing capital and attracting investments. Moreover, ESG rating agencies source all the necessary data from the very companies they are meant to assess, leading to an evident conflict of interest. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive solution to urgently address this gap in ESG disclosure. Leveraging the unique capabilities of Neural Networks (NN) to comprehend and replicate intricate patterns, we train a NN using available environmental and rating data from large companies. The NN learns how to replicate ratings based on the available information. Once the network is adequately trained, we employ it to generate ratings for SMEs that would otherwise lack any form of rating. Another point of innovation is represented by the type of data used, i.e. we utilize data acquired through satellite observations within the European Union (EU) Copernicus Program, ensuring an impartial means of gathering information on environmental activities. Our NN is fed with satellite observations, with the target being the ratings recognized by supervisory agencies. Once the network has been satisfactorily trained and can accurately reproduce the target set of ratings, it is directly applied to the same dataset for a group of SME companies. In doing so, we establish a methodology for consistently rating SMEs’ environmental performance in alignment with the methodology used for larger companies. © 2023 The Author(s)",,10.1016/j.ecolind.2023.111151,ESG rating;Neural Network;Satellite observations;SME;Economic and social effects;Environmental management;Investments;Satellites;Sustainable development;Decision framework;Decision-making process;Environmental performance;Environmental social and governance rating;Investment decisions;Large companies;Neural-networks;Regulatory frameworks;Satellite observations;Small-and-medium enterprise;artificial neural network;European Union;innovation;observational method;satellite data;small and medium-sized enterprise;sustainability;Decision making,,,,,True,"The article discusses the use of Neural Networks to assess SMEs' environmental performance, directly involving AI technology application in SME operations, aligning with the research focus on AI adoption and its impact on SMEs."

However, traditional credit risk assessment models cannot truly reflect the credit status of financing companies. In recent years, scholars working in this field have proposed using machine learning methods to predict the credit risk of supply chain enterprises, achieving good results. Nonetheless, there is no consensus on which approach is the most suitable for manufacturing companies. This study took small and medium-sized manufacturing enterprises as the research object, selected risk evaluation indicators according to the characteristics of the small and medium-sized manufacturing enterprises, and built a credit risk evaluation system. On this basis, we selected SMEs on China’s stock market from 2015 to 2020 as the sample data and evaluated corporate credit risk based on four commonly used machine learning algorithms. Then, combined with the evaluation results, a partial dependence plot method was used to visually analyze the important indicators. The results showed that a credit risk evaluation system for supply chain finance for manufacturing SMEs could be composed of the profile of the financing companies, the asset status of the financing companies, the profile of the core companies, and the operation of supply chains. The use of a random forest algorithm made it possible to more accurately assess the credit risk of manufacturing supply chain finance. Since the impacts of different indicators on the evaluation results were quite different, supply chain enterprises and financial service institutions should formulate corresponding strategies according to specific situations. © 2023 by the authors.",,10.3390/su15021087,manufacturing;PDP;random forest;risk assessment;supply chain finance;China;algorithm;finance;machine learning;manufacturing;prediction;risk assessment;small and medium-sized enterprise;stock market;supply chain management,,,,,True,"The article focuses on the use of machine learning algorithms by SMEs, specifically manufacturing SMEs, to assess credit risk, which aligns with the research topic of AI/ML adoption in SME operations and its impact on organizational performance."

Whereas Industry 4.0 is still focused primarily on economic objectives to be achieved through digital transformation and automation of monotonous work processes, Industry 5.0 will also bring in social and ecological objectives. The focus is on holistic, sustainable, and human-centered value creation. Thus, the complexity of digitalization is increasing with the implementation of direct collaboration between humans and machines. In particular, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are faced with major challenges as they have limited resources for implementing a successful digitalization strategy. This makes the use of maturity models (MMs) a valuable tool for shaping the strategically aligned digitalization transition of companies. In this context, this paper reviews whether the currently existing MMs for Industry 4.0 address the specific requirements of Industry 5.0, and sufficiently consider a human-centered approach along with the assessment of readiness for disruptive technologies in companies (especially SMEs).

For a given tool (i.e., geometry or materials), many shop floors still follow a standard rule by pre-setting a tool life, which is conservative but not realistic. Premature failure of atool can cause unexpected machine downtime and material losses, while another tool could serve beyond that pre-set life. As a result, optimized tool life and productivity cannot be achieved. Moreover, nowadays, there is an incread demand of process monitoring and optimization on the unmanned andthe semi-automated shop floors.        Tool condition monitoring (TCM) systems for process improvement and optimization have been in research for several decades. Both offline and online TCM systems are invented and discussed. A wide range of original publications are reported focusing on different sub-topics, e.g., specific machining process-based TCM methods, measurement or signal acquisition methods, processing methods, and classifiers. With the recent evolution of smart sensors in the era of Industry 4.0, development of online TCM systems received much attention to the researchers. Accordingly, research on some sub-topics also gets motivated into different directions, such as, feasibility of power or current sensors, machine vision technique, and combination of multi-sensors. Thus, from the industrial viewpoint, the current state of implementation of the propod TCM systems for (near) real-time process monitoring and control needs to be clear. This paper presents the state-of-the-art of the TCM systems covering three major machining operations, discusses their application feasibility in industry environments, and states some current TCMS implementations.

The data-driven approach is applied by installing the voltage and current sensors, collecting the associated mass data and processing them under normal and abnormal (angular misalignment) conditions. Two categories of features are extracted from the dynamic resistance (DR) and the voltage and current ones that are decomposed by wavelet transform (WT). The DR features are extracted from the DR profile and some critical features are selected by a t-test methodology. In the case of the WT-based features, the critical ones are selected by a max-relevance and min-redundancy (mRMR) and a sequential backward selection (SBS) wrapper. Consequently, three types of critical feature sets, such as DR features, WT features, and hybrid features combining those, are prepared to train machine learning-based models.

Here, we show, using a combination of remote sensing observations, regional climate model outputs, reanalysis data, and artificial neural networks, that unprecedented atmospheric conditions (1948-2019) occurring in the summer of 2019 over Greenland promoted new record or close-to-record values of surface mass balance (SMB), runoff, and snowfall. Specifically, runoff in 2019 ranked second within the 1948-2019 period (after 2012) and first in terms of surface mass balance negative anomaly for the hydrological year 1 September 2018-31 August 2019. The summer of 2019 was characterized by an exceptional persistence of anticyclonic conditions that, in conjunction with low albedo associated with reduced snowfall in summer, enhanced the melt-albedo feedback by promoting the absorption of solar radiation and favored advection of warm, moist air along the western portion of the ice sheet towards the north, where the surface melt has been the highest since 1948. The analysis of the frequency of daily 500 hPa geopotential heights obtained from artificial neural networks shows that the total number of days with the five most frequent atmospheric patterns that characterized the summer of 2019 was 5 standard deviations above the 1981-2010 mean, confirming the exceptional nature of the 2019 season over Greenland.",,10.5194/tc-14-1209-2020     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),SURFACE MASS-BALANCE;TERRA-NOVA BAY;CLIMATE;SUMMER;CIRCULATION;SIMULATION;TRENDS;IMPACT;ALBEDO;MODEL,,,,,False,"The article focuses on atmospheric conditions and ice sheet mass balance using artificial neural networks, which is unrelated to AI adoption in SMEs and their operational impact."

Experiment 1 included 31 beef heifers 11 to 13 months old and experiment 2 included 31 beef heifers 19 to 21 months old. Heifers were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 groups (control and PGF(2 alpha) 5 days before SMB treatment). Heifers were bled 10 days before PGF(2 alpha) treatment, immediately before PGF(2 alpha) and SMB treatments, at the time of implant removal, and twice weekly after implant removal. Heifers in experiment 2 were observed twice daily for estrus for 5 days after PGF(2 alpha) treatment and for 3 days after norgestomet implant removal. Based on the blood samples collected before SMB treatment, 15 heifers in experiment 1 and every heifer in experiment 2 were with estrous cycles. All heifers in experiment 1 had progesterone concentrations <0.5 ng/ml 2 days after implant removal. However, progesterone concentrations during the luteal phase in control heifers with estrous cycles were higher (P < 0.05) than in PGF(2 alpha) treated heifers with estrous cycles and in heifers previously without estrous cycles. In experiment 2, based on the occurrence of estrus and progesterone concentrations, heifers were also classified as metestrus or diestrus at the time of SMB treatment. The data were analyzed as a 2 X 2 factorial with treatment (control or PGF(2 alpha)) and stage of the cycle (metestrus and diestrus) as main effects. More metestrus heifers (40%) had progesterone concentrations > 1.0 ng/ml 2 days after implant removal than diestrus heifers (0%), In addition, progesterone concentrations during the luteal phase in metestrus heifers were lower (P < 0.05) than in diestrus heifers. PGF(2 alpha) treatment had no effect (P > 0.25) on the number of heifers with > 1.0 ng/ml progesterone 2 days after implant removal and progesterone concentrations during the luteal phase. There was no treatment by stage of the estrous cycle interactions. In summary, the administration of PGF(2 alpha) 5 days before SMB decreased the calving rate by causing more heifers to be metestrus at SMB treatment. Fewer metestrus heifers (than diestrus heifers) were synchronized (with < 1.0 ng/ml of progesterone 2 days after implant removal) to SMB treatment and those synchronized had lower progesterone concentrations during the luteal phase.

To ensure reliability of the production process and satisfactory quality of the final product, several control parameters need to be adjusted to modify the process behavior. The appropriate parameter allocation is typically determined during product and process development using FEM simulations. The simulations provide the ability to estimate the expected geometric shape of the final product and adjust the control parameters accordingly. However, simulations are only as good as their underlying computational model and can reflect reality only to a restricted degree. Deviations between the simulated product quality and real quality measurements of the physically produced product, the so-called sim2real gap, cannot be entirely avoided and persist even after several optimization cycles. In this paper, we address this problem and propose a data-driven approach to correct the sim2real gap. At its core, our approach is based on a random forest regression model that predicts simulation deviations based on process and product characteristics. The input data for the model is composed of control parameters from the extrusion and blow molding process as well as data from intermediate simulation results. Given the multitude of different variables, we incorporate extensive feature selection and engineering to extract the most valuable information to predict the sim2real gap. We train and evaluate our approach in a real use-case in which several different product geometries are manufactured with differently configured control parameters. The results show that our approach successfully reduces the sim2real-gap significantly. In addition, we show that with carefully designed feature engineering and parameterization, a model trained on one set of products with certain geometrical characteristics can be transferred and applied to another set of products with distinctively different geometrical characteristics.

According to the results of static adsorption experiment, AB-8 resin was selected for Tartary buckwheat shell flavonoids (TBSF) adsorption. The adsorption isotherm, resin adsorption thermodynamic and dynamic adsorption parameters were studied. And the adsorption of AB-8 resin for TBSF was determined as an endothermic process. Results of preparative chromatography experiment showed that TBSF could be efficiently purified by AB-8 resin. And the optimal parameters were: feed concentration 25 mg/mL, desorption flow rate 2.5 mL/min. Under these conditions, the TBSF were separated effectively.

Trials were conducted in 500 mL Erlenmeyer flasks that contained 200-300 mL of a 3% glucose, 0.5% yeast extract medium, and either 0-0.225% SMB (wt/wt) added, or initially adjusted to pH levels between 1.8-6.5.

Results showed that SMB levels up to 0.05% significantly lengthened the lag phase (from 27 to 79 h) but had no effect on productivity. Maximal productivity varied between 0.054-0.057 g/L/h, whereas overall productivity was 0.042-0.045 g/L/h. Biomass concentrations ranged from 7.1-8.4 g/L.

In one instance the SMB tolerance of P. sajor caju was increased to 0.075% by repeatedly exposing the organism to sublethal levels of the chemical; however, this trait was not maintained in later trials.

Thus it appears that SMB might be useful in controlling bacterial contamination, but may not be as effective against fungal contaminants. The optimum pH range in terms of lag phase length, biomass yield, and productivity was 4.5-5.5, however, in certain trials P. sajor caju still exhibited good growth parameters at pH levels as low as 3.8-4.0. pH levels below 3.8 and above 5.8 greatly reduced both growth rates and yields. Acidic pH levels (3.8-4.5) were also effective in controlling the majority of bacterial and fungal contaminants encountered. Therefore low pH or perhaps a combination of low pH and SMB should be useful in developing a large scale system for submerged cultivation of P. sajor caju.

The emergence of digital financial inclusion has introduced a transformative framework to address this critical issue, offering new avenues for SMEs to access capital. This paper explores the dynamic relationship between digital financial inclusion and the funding constraints encountered by SMEs. Governments, recognizing the importance of SME expansion, have actively promoted regulations to incentivize financial institutions to adopt innovative service models and directly support SMEs. This paper delves into the multifaceted landscape of policy dynamics and its impact on SMEs, underscoring their pivotal role in the broader economic fabric. Recent developments in digital financial inclusion have combined technological innovation and deliberate policy measures. Incorporating artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms has significantly enhanced the accuracy of financial services, enabling tailored solutions for SMEs. The widespread adoption of mobile banking apps and digital payment platforms has expanded financial access, especially in historically underserved areas. Blockchain technology has introduced transparency and security to financial transactions. While existing research has highlighted the potential benefits of digital financial inclusion for SMEs, there remains a need for a comprehensive empirical understanding of the intricate relationship between these initiatives and the specific funding challenges faced by SMEs. This paper addresses this gap by conducting a thorough empirical analysis, shedding light on unexplored aspects, and providing valuable insights for policymakers and financial institutions. Our study's objectives are multifaceted. We aim to assess the impact of digital financial inclusion on SME funding constraints through a comprehensive empirical study. By examining pilot projects in specific geographic areas, we seek to uncover nuanced observations and disparities. Furthermore, our research enriches the theoretical framework by exploring the complex interplay between digital financial inclusion and SME financial viability. The findings reveal that while digital financial inclusion has the potential to alleviate funding constraints for SMEs, it faces challenges related to technical assistance, information disparities, and limitations in the magnitude and duration of funding. This complexity underscores the need for a nuanced approach to policy development and intervention, considering socio-economic factors and demographic variations. This study contributes to the evolving landscape of digital financial inclusion and its impact on SME finance. It provides valuable insights for SME managers and policymakers, emphasizing the importance of closing information gaps and offering a range of financing options. Ultimately, it calls for a strategic equilibrium between immediate and long-term funding choices to cater to diverse SME growth trajectories.

This can be achieved by transformation into the digital economy, use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques, integrating business processes and to have real-time information which will enable senior management to make better, quicker informed decisions. Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) is one of the solutions for the SMEs to overcome these challenges and to obtain a competitive advantage. Subanidja, and Broto, 2019 stated that ERP systems are still not widely implemented by SMEs compared to their introduction in large businesses. However, the SME have a justifiable reputation for being proactive, open, willing and receptive to the adoption of new technologies, concepts and improvements. Also, SMEs differ in several inherent characteristics which are likely to impact on the ERP system implementations, hence it does not make sense to use the same frameworks that have been developed for large companies to implement ERP system within SMEs. One of the main risks of adopting ERP in SMEs is that SMEs have limited resources, so they cannot afford to fail to implement ERP system. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to explore ERP implementation process in SME context. The developed framework has been used to implement an ERP system in a SME. It highlighted the issues that need to be addressed while implementing ERP system in SMEs such as clearly defined scope of implementation procedure, suitable project planning and minimal customisation of the system selected for implementation. This study contributed to both research and practice and the research findings could aid practitioners and SMEs when embarking on ERP projects, as well as, to suggest future research avenues.

Pelleted samples were collected at conditioning temperatures of 66 and 82 degrees C and retention times of 30 and 60 s within temperature. Pelleting conditions had no effect on DON levels, but as SMB inclusion increased in pelleted DDGS, DON levels were reduced (quadratic; P < 0.001).

Standard blood tests do not sufficiently quantify these risks. Global coagulation assays (GCAs) provide a more comprehensive assessment of coagulation. Objectives: We aimed to evaluate if GCAs are predictive of spontaneous major bleeding (sMB) in CKD. Methods: Adult patients with CKD (estimated glomerular filtration rate, <30 mL/min/ 1.73m(2)) were recruited to this pilot prospective observational study. Testing with GCAs (thromboelastography, overall hemostatic potential, calibrated automated thrombogram, and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1) was performed, and the results were correlated to sMB events. Results: Eighty-seven CKD patients (median age, 67 years; 67.8% male) were included, with median follow-up of 3.1 years. CKD patients demonstrated elevated fibrinogen, factor VIII, and von Willebrand factor antigen levels, while other conventional coagulation test results were within reference intervals. Ten episodes of sMB (11.5%) were captured (3.0/100 person-years), with no significant association demonstrated between sMB and antiplatelet use (P = .36), platelet count (P = .14), or renal function (urea, P = .27; estimated glomerular filtration rate, P = .09). CKD patients with sMB had more hypocoagulable GCA parameters compared with those without sMB. The lowest quartiles of endogenous thrombin potential (subhazard ratio [sHR], 7.11; 95% CI, 1.8427.45), overall hemostatic potential (sHR, 6.81; 95% CI, 1.77-26.16), and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (sHR, 5.26; 95% CI, 1.55-17.91) were associated with sMB. Conclusion: This pilot study demonstrates that GCAs such as thrombin and fibrin generation may predict sMB risk in patients with CKD, which has potential to be practice-changing.

The automation of this process is important to maintain high quality along with the high manufacturing throughput. With recent developments in deep learning and computer vision technologies, it has become possible to detect various features from the images with near-human accuracy. However, many of these approaches are data intensive. Training and deployment of such a system on manufacturing floors may become expensive and time-consuming. The need for large amounts of training data is one of the limitations of the applicability of these approaches in real-world manufacturing systems. In this work, we propose the application of a Siamese convolutional neural network to do one-shot recognition for such a task. Our results demonstrate how one-shot learning can be used in quality control of steel by identification of defects on the steel surface. This method can significantly reduce the requirements of training data and can also be run in real-time. (c) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The application of decision-tree and instance-based machine learning methods to the transformed task data supported prediction of SME task selection with greater than 95 % accuracy, and SME action selection at a frequency of 10 Hz with greater than 63 % accuracy, with real time constraints placing limits on algorithm selection. A complete processing model is presented for a path driving task, with the induced generative model deviating from the SME chosen path by less than 2 meters on average.

The prediction of axial concentration profiles along the beds in a unit is crucial for the operating optimization of SMB. Though the correlation shared by operating variables of SMB has an enormous impact on the operational state of the device, these correlations have been long overlooked, especially by the data-driven models. This study proposes an operating variable-based graph convolutional network (OV-GCN) to enclose the underrepresented correlations and precisely predict axial concentration profiles prediction in SMB. The OV-GCN estimates operating variables with the Spearman correlation coefficient and incorporates them in the adjacency matrix of a graph convolutional network for information propagation and feature extraction. Compared with Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Regression, and Backpropagation Neural Network, the values of the three performance evaluation metrics, namely MAE, RMSE, and R-2, indicate that OV-GCN has better prediction accuracy in predicting five essential aromatic compounds' axial concentration profiles of an SMB for separating p-xylene (PX). In addition, the OV-GCN method demonstrates a remarkable ability to provide high-precision and fast predictions in three industrial case studies. With the goal of simultaneously maximizing PX purity and yield, we employ the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II optimization method to perform multi-objective optimization of the PX purity and yield. The outcome suggests a promising approach to extracting and representing correlations among operating variables in data-driven process modeling.

In this paper, we utilize Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) imagery, applying the continuity equation to obtain altitudinal specific mass balance (SMB) for 615 glaciers (>2 km(2)) during 2002-2011, 2011-2020, and 2002-2020 to research glacial health and its response to climatic forcing. The results show dissimilar glacier SMB patterns between 2002-2011 (0.10 +/- 0.14 m w.e. a(-1)), 2011-2020 (-0.12 +/- 0.14 m w.e. a(-1)) and 2002-2020 (-0.01 +/- 0.07 m w.e. a(-1)). Additionally, the glacier equilibrium line altitude (ELA) in WK was 5788 m, 5744 m, and 5786 m, respectively, and the corresponding accumulation area ratios (AARs) were 0.59, 0.62, and 0.58, during 2002-2011, 2011-2020, and 2002-2020, respectively.

In addition, the ANN model indicated that the glacier ELA was less sensitive when the integrated water vapor transport (IVT) change exceeded 0.7 kg m(-1)s(-1). Moreover, compared with IVT (-121.57 m/kg m(-1)s(-1)), glacier ELA shifts were chiefly dominated by summer skin temperature (+154.66 m/degrees C) in the last two decades. From 2002-2011 and 2011-2020, glacier SMB was more susceptible to summer skin temperature (-0.38 m w.e./degrees C and -0.16 m w.e./degrees C, respectively), while during 2002-2020, it was more influenced by IVT (0.45 m w.e./kg m(-1)s(-1)). In contrast with eastern WK, glaciers in western WK were healthier, although mitigation measures are still needed to safeguard glacier health and prevent possible natural hazards in this region. Finally, we believe that the inconsistent change between glacier SMB and ELAs from 2002-2020 was connected with ice rheology and that the combined effects of skin temperature and IVT can explain the WK glacier anomaly.",,10.3390/rs14143465     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),specific mass balance;continuity equation;glacier health;glacier response;West Kunlun;EQUILIBRIUM-LINE ALTITUDE;SEA-LEVEL RISE;MASS-BALANCE SENSITIVITY;PRECIPITATION SEASONALITY;TIBETAN PLATEAU;SURFACE MASS;GEODETIC GLACIER;MOUNTAIN GLACIER;ENERGY-BALANCE;VOLUME CHANGE,,,,,False,"The article focuses on glacial mass change and environmental analysis using ANN, which is unrelated to AI adoption in SMEs or organizational performance."

Despite the potential advantages of cost reductions associated with office space and flexible working environments, this model presents difficulties in effectively controlling and monitoring employee work activities. Applying advanced technologies in human resources can enable organizations to address these challenges effectively. However, SMEs face challenges in adopting advanced technologies such as AI and facial recognition due to financial constraints, lack of technical expertise, and concerns about cost-effectiveness. The paper focuses on developing a low-cost attendance monitoring mobile application that utilizes real-time facial recognition and location analysis for SMEs. We try to enhance the real-time registration and identification flow with the camera of employees' mobiles by handling large data streams and integrating the system with a cloud-based solution. First, the AI facial detection module uses the camera on mobile devices as input devices to ensure the flexibility of face recognition data input. The AI Engine layer is built by applying a deep learning-based facial recognition model that was trained using a large dataset of collected employee faces. Employees' facial identities using the Resnet34 model integrated Additive Angular Margin Loss function to identify employees' facial identities. The facial recognition model is designed to operate in real-time, with the ability to detect and identify employees as they check in and out of the workplace. Finally, we demonstrate an experimental prototype on a mobile phone application using React Native, NodeJS, and Python. The mobile application is designed to operate on both iOS and Android platforms, ensuring widespread accessibility for SMEs. The experimental findings provide empirical evidence that our system exhibits accuracy and efficiency in the tasks of facial identification and personnel matching.

BP neural network algorithm is the representative of artificial neural network algorithm. Due to the relatively small scale of small, medium, and micro enterprises and lack of mortgage assets, the biggest market risk they usually face is credit risk. In order to avoid huge economic losses for banks, the impact of risk analysis on credit decision-making is the key. Therefore, the establishment of a scientific and complete credit risk assessment system has become the primary task. This paper mainly uses BP neural network algorithm to analyze the risk of small and medium-sized enterprises and solve the problem of credit decision-making. First, analyze the various influencing factors that cause credit risk, and layer the factors according to the degree of risk; secondly, use the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method in mathematical modeling to rank each factor; then, use the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process to calculate the weight of each indicator factor as calculated by establishing the risk value function, using the function expression of the annual interest rate and the total credit formula to calculate the total credit, which solves the problem of the loan line of each enterprise, and use the optimal linear programming to give priority to the selection of the line and the interest rate. Enterprises: Finally, for enterprises that do not have a credit rating, reasonable adjustments are made to the quota by establishing lending qualification expression, taking into account the impact of unexpected external factors, establishing an improved annual interest rate function, and achieving an optimized credit strategy through the establishment and solution of the model.

The results indicate that the adoption of the Internet of Things demonstrates a significant positive effect (p = 0.0000, T-statistic = 4.6695), improving real-time monitoring and operational efficiency. Blockchain also positively affects SME internationalization (p-value = 0.0085, T-statistic = 2.6427), enhancing supply chain transparency and ensuring compliance with international standards. In contrast, the influence of artificial intelligence is marginally significant (p = 0.0799, T-statistic = 1.7548), constrained by financial limitations and lack of expertise. The moderating effects of eco-digital learning show mixed results. It significantly moderates the relationship between the Internet of Things and internationalization in a negative direction (coefficient = –0.0651, p = 0.0475), suggesting that increased eco-digital learning may add complexity, potentially delaying the benefits of the Internet of Things. For blockchain, eco-digital learning enhances its positive impact (p = 0.0277, T-statistic = 2.2085) by strengthening the organization’s ability to leverage transparency and sustainability. However, no significant moderating effect is observed for artificial intelligence (p = 0.2066, T-statistic = 1.2646), indicating limited integration due to resource constraints. These findings highlight the importance of technological readiness, resource allocation, and alignment of digital learning to fully capitalize on the benefits of these technologies in the global market expansion of SMEs. © Faisol, Hestin Sri Widiawati, Risky Aswi Ramadhani, Bambang Agus Sumantri, 2025.",,10.21511/ppm.23(1).2025.06,artificial intelligence;blockchain;eco-digital learning;green supply chain;Internet of Things;SME internationalization,,,,,True,"The article examines AI adoption in SMEs, focusing on benefits and challenges, which aligns with the research on AI's impact on SME operations and competitiveness."

E-commerce is a development direction, not a simple transaction method. E-commerce is widely used in financial, service, and retail industries. The addition of e-commerce has promoted the transformation of these industries to informationization. This study uses the analytical capabilities of artificial intelligence to analyze the utilization rate of e-commerce in smes. The article and research ideas are firstly using artificial intelligence to build an analysis model, and secondly, using the results of model analysis to explore the utilization rate of e-commerce in small and medium-sized enterprises. Finally, according to the current situation of e-commerce utilization rate of small and medium-sized enterprises, relevant growth strategies are put forward. This paper builds an e-commerce application analysis model based on artificial intelligence technology. After multi-layer verification, the model has good performance in theory and practice. Using this model to analyze the application rate of e-commerce in small and medium-sized enterprises, we can find that there are still the following problems in the application of e-commerce in small and medium-sized enterprises. (1) Lack of experience and lack of guiding standards (2) Lack of reasonable business strategies (3) Lack of offline interaction with users. In order to solve these problems, small and medium-sized enterprises should (1) strengthen publicity and innovation and promote brand marketing (2) strengthen the cultivation and construction of talents (3) optimize the industrial model and reduce industrial costs (4) improve the industrial model and marketing of e-commerce system.  © 2024 - IOS Press.

Gradient inversion is a family of privacy attacks that recovers data from its generated gradients. Seemingly, FL can provide a degree of protection against gradient inversion attacks on weight updates, since the gradient of a single step is concealed by the accumulation of gradients over multiple local iterations. In this work, we propose a principled way to extend gradient inversion attacks to weight updates in FL, thereby better exposing weaknesses in the presumed privacy protection inherent in FL. In particular, we propose a surrogate model method based on the characteristic of two-dimensional gradient flow and low-rank property of local updates. Our method largely boosts the ability of gradient inversion attacks on weight updates containing many iterations and achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. Additionally, our method runs up to 100× faster than the SOTA baseline in the common FL scenario. Our work re-evaluates and highlights the privacy risk of sharing network weights.

The aim is to avoid regulatory friction and fragmentation and to create a well-functioning internal market for AI systems and technologies. However, the policy and regulatory choices should not obstruct the innovative potential and transformative impact of AI systems and technologies on the society and economy. The Draft AI Act, therefore, introduces AI regulatory sand-boxes, as a testing ground for deciding what to regulate and how. This is a novel regulatory approach, fostering innovation, development, and testing of AI systems under strict regulatory oversight before these systems are placed on the market.

SMEs in particular, with their limited resources and significant backlog in terms of the digitalisation of corporate processes, find themselves in a digital talent trap which threatens to grow ever larger as digitalisation progresses. In other words, the digital talent gap could become a digital talent trap for SMEs in terms of digitalisation. The aim of this work is to derive from this insight a pragmatic and cost-effective solution which, in addition to the highly competitive ""buy"" option - i.e., classic recruitment via the labour market - offers a ""make"" option for SMEs that focuses more on their own employee resources. The research approach was based on two steps. In the first step, various literature approaches for recording and measuring digital skills were analysed in order to summarise them and derive potential digital talent profiles. The second step was to search for suitable software packages that are able to detect these profiles or skills in company documents. With these data sets, an analysis was carried out in the third step using AI algorithms - created in Python - in order to identify potential digital talents. An anonymised personal data set was used to test the above decision-making process. The findings show that SMEs could already access powerful, user-friendly and low-cost digital AI tools when searching for digital talent - especially in the search for digital talents within the company. The assumption that only larger companies with the corresponding financial resources can afford this option cannot be confirmed. The originality of the work lies in the finding that suitable AI tools exist for SMEs to search for digital talent, but that these are not currently being used extensively. Barriers such as prohibitively high costs or the low user-friendliness of AI tools could not be confirmed within the scope of this study. © 2023 Mykolo Romerio Universitetas.

It helps avoid performance bottleneck and data analytics latency at the central server of a Cloud. However, when Fog computing is deployed, the edge nodes are responsible in data analysis including learning and recognizing patterns from the incoming data streams. Hence it is crucial to find appropriate data mining algorithm(s) which is lightweight in operation and accurate in predictive performance. In this paper, the suitability of data mining and data stream mining algorithms are investigated in Fog computing environment. Specifically, non-black-box machine learning models such as decision trees are looked into, with a quick pre-processing function implemented by correlation-based feature selection algorithm coupled with traditional search methods and particle swarm optimization search method.

The research employed the Louvain clustering algorithm to effectively group the loan recipients based on their cumulative repayment amounts over time, and two distinct machine learning techniques, namely logistic regression (LR) and k-nearest neighbour (k-NN) were harnessed to evaluate their efficacy in classifying recipients' risk levels, namely low-risk or high-risk. The LR model achieved mean accuracy score of 100% which indicates a high level of precision that can effectively predict the risk of SME loan repayment. This is further supported by the Area Under the Curve (AUC) value of 1.0 obtained by the LR model which suggests that the model has achieved optimal separation of the two classes, and therefore it is highly reliable for risk prediction. This technique is believed to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of credit risk assessment that could enable financial institutions (FIs) to optimize their decision-making processes and mitigate potential losses caused by the defaulting loans.

In this volatile, uncertain, complex and ambivalent environment (VUCA world), companies need responsible employees who recognise the individual need for action and initiate concrete measures early to increase a company’s resilience. These measures affect multiple divisions. For example, disruptions in the supply chain are mitigated by various configuration elements such as expanding the supplier network or increasing stock in the company's own production. Therefore, measures encompass every element of the value network, whether in production or logistics. The example also shows that measures to increase resilience can influence other target characteristics of a company: Inventory increases can buy resilience at the expense of resource efficiency. Thus, measures must be defined for each design element depending on individual requirements in terms of resilience and must consider the scope for action of the respective company. This poses a great challenge, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Here, decision-making is done by generalists who often do not have the detailed knowledge for this specific problem or the capacity for this additional task. The danger is that SMEs will take insufficient measures that do not secure their future viability in a VUCA world. In this paper, a solution approach for a methodology is presented, that allows to derive influences on production companies from the developments in a VUCA world and measures to increase resilience can be identified depending on individual company characteristics. Furthermore, a possible conceptualisation of the methodology in an AI-based software product is presented, which supports SMEs in the outlined complex problem by enabling them to apply the methodology. Both will be realised in a research project. © 2023, Publish-Ing in cooperation with TIB - Leibniz Information Centre for Science and Technology University Library.

Second, we employ the weighted one-mode projection approach to extract a projected-SMEs network that reveals the relationship among SMEs from the CEs-SMEs network and examine whether the ML algorithms’ forecasting performances is improved when considering attributes in the projected-SMEs network. Third, we analyze the correlation between SME’s credit risk and individual network attribute to specifically understand the impact of enterprise relationship on credit risk. Overall, the empirical results indicate that the forecasting performance is obviously better when enterprise transaction relationship is considered, and it is further enhanced after we apply weighted one-mode projection approach.

Wide opportunities for AI are seen in tasks associated with credit scoring. However, the expected potential and benefits of AI-based credit scoring and the overall path to digitalised lending could be challenged by the fact that a relatively large number of SMEs in Europe are credit invisible due to their financing patterns, that limit the availability of credit history and other creditworthiness sensitive data needed to build and train AI models. The research aims to estimate the nature and availability of credit scoring relevant SMEs data in different European countries. Research methods respective to the above-stated aim are the following: scientific literature review, descriptive, and country to country comparative analysis of the data from the Survey on the Access to Finance of Enterprises (SAFE). The survey data indicate that the share of credit invisible SMEs changes in the range of 1030%, but there is no direct relationship with the characteristics of the country. The initiatives to score the creditworthiness of SMEs should consider the share of SMEs that do not use services of the traditional financing sector, which means that data about its creditworthiness are limited. The whole population of SMEs could be covered by AI models incorporating both conventional financial data from credit visible SMEs processed by machine learning as well as unstructured non-financial data (describing credit invisible SMEs) processed by deep learning techniques and methods. Thus, we claim that despite the huge potential of AI incorporation into creditworthiness evaluation, the use of AI is not a magic pill, enhancing easier SME's access to finance, unless its use is aligned to the available data. Accordingly to the accessible data, different AI tools and techniques should be applied in credit scoring applications.  © 2021 IEEE.",,10.1109/ICTE51655.2021.9584833,artificial intelligence;creditworthiness;digital lending;SMEs credit scoring;Deep learning;Population statistics;Surveys;Credit scoring;Creditworthiness;Digital lending;European Countries;Financial data;Financial industry;Integral part;Intelligence models;Sensitive datas;SME credit scoring;Finance,,,,,True,"The article discusses the use of AI, including machine learning and deep learning, in SME credit scoring, addressing benefits and challenges related to data availability, which aligns with the research focus on AI adoption in SME operations and its impact on performance and competitiveness."

Managers often rely on experience-based forecasting heuristics, which face challenges, as demand is dependent on external factors such as weather conditions, holidays, and regional events. Introducing practical AI-based sales forecasting techniques is a way to improve operational and financial planning and automate repetitive forecasting tasks. This case study proposes an approach to work with F&B owners in creating and introducing machine learning (ML)-based sales forecasting tailored to the unique local aspects of the business. It enhances demand forecasting in the F&B domain by identifying data types and sources that improve predictive models and bolster managerial trust. The case study uses over 5 years of hourly sales data from a fast-food franchise in Germany. It trains a predictive algorithm using historical sales, promotional activities, weather conditions, regional holidays and events, as well as macroeconomic indicators. The AI model surpasses heuristic forecasts, reducing the root mean squared error by 22% to 33% and the mean average error by 19% to 31%.

This study proposes an innovative multi-step clustering procedure to segment customers based on load-shape patterns at the daily and intra-daily time horizons. Smart meter data is split between daily and hourly normalized time series to assess monthly, weekly, daily, and hourly seasonality patterns separately. The dimensionality reduction implicit in the splitting allows a direct approach to clustering raw daily energy time series data. The intraday clustering procedure sequentially identifies representative hourly day-unit profiles for each customer and the entire population. For the first time, a step function approach is applied to reduce time series dimensionality. Customer attributes embedded in surveys are employed to build external clustering validation metrics using Cramer’s V correlation factors and to identify statistically significant determinants of load-shape in energy usage. In addition, a time series features engineering approach is used to extract 16 relevant demand flexibility indicators that characterize customers and corresponding clusters along four different axes: available Energy (E), Temporal patterns (T), Consistency (C), and Variability (V). The methodology is implemented on a real-world electricity consumption dataset of 325 Small and Medium-sized Enterprise (SME) customers, identifying 4 daily and 6 hourly easy-to-interpret, well-defined clusters. The application of the methodology includes selecting key parameters via grid search and a thorough comparison of clustering distances and methods to ensure the robustness of the results. Further research can test the scalability of the methodology to larger datasets from various customer segments (households and large commercial) and locations with different weather and socioeconomic conditions.

The study also finds that ‘hazardous’ feature combinations interact towards significantly higher (or lower) financial distress. Most notable are company age interactions, historic overdue accounts receivable, and cash ratios. Finally, applying explainable artificial intelligence techniques lowers the inherent opaqueness of SME entities, thus reducing information asymmetries between companies and potential lenders. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",,10.1007/978-3-031-25344-7_42,Explainable AI;Financial distress prediction;SHAP;SME,,,,,True,"The article examines the use of Artificial Neural Networks and explainable AI techniques in SME financial distress prediction, aligning with the research focus on AI applications in SME operations and their impact on organizational performance."

Quality, as a main concern in manufacturing, is also to benefit from this change of paradigm by introducing new key enabling technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) into quality management, earning it the label of Quality 4.0 (Q4.0). The implementation of these paradigms is still gathering research efforts as it is arduous to design and realize effective end-to-end Decision Support Systems (DSSs) for Q4.0, with several dimensions to consider when integrating digitalization with quality. This is an even more challenging task when it comes to SMEs’ efforts to implement these concepts, given the particularities of these entities. This paper presents an approach to design a Total Manufacturing Quality 4.0 (TMQ 4.0) DSS by combining Sensor Network (SN) data and historical data in an end-to-end framework. Furthermore, the paper presents the validation of the approach through a case study application in a metal-cutting high-precision manufacturing SME. It shows promising Q4.0 estimations with regular Machine Learning (ML) algorithms (kNN, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, XGboost, feed-forward Deep Neural Network) when the steps of tending to data quality, data augmentation, and end-to-end design and implementation are applied. By providing building blocks for an end-to-end Q4.0 DSS design and implementation in an integrated quality control application, this approach aims at supporting end-users in the in-process quality control of their manufacturing operations. © 2025 The Authors",,10.1016/j.jii.2025.100833,Artificial intelligence;Defect management;Industry 4.0;IoT;Quality 4.0;Sensor network;Smart manufacturing;SME;Data quality;Deep neural networks;Failure analysis;Logistic regression;Metal cutting;Process control;Production control;Total quality management;Decision supports;Defect management;End to end;Manufacturing IS;Manufacturing quality;Quality 4.0;Sensors network;Smart manufacturing;SME;Support systems;Smart manufacturing,,,,,True,"The article discusses the use of AI and ML in an SME manufacturing context, focusing on quality management and decision support systems, which aligns with investigating AI adoption and its impact on SME operations and performance."

The treatments were either a progestagen ear implant (SMB), a progesterone intravaginal devide (PRID + PMSG), or two injections of a prostaglandin analogue (PG). Prostagen treatments effectively synchronised oestrus with similar numbers of animals exhibiting oestrus within 2 days of treatment, as were observed over 21 days in the control group. The prostaglandin treatment was much less effective (control 79%, SMB 72%, PRID + PMSG 71%, and PG 45%). Conception to timed insemination in the SMB- and PG-synchronised heifers was lower than that obtained in the other treatments (control 33%, SMB 17%, PRID + PMSG 33%, and PG 25%). In the suckling cows the conception rates of the progestagen-treated groups (48 and 50%) were better than that following PG (20%) with the controls (37%) intermediate. Plasma progesterone levels  indicated that anoestrus was not the major reason for the poor performance of the PG-treated cows. An additional group of 36 cows treated with progestagen and PMSG before Day 30 postpartum indicated some advantages from this procedure in reducing the interval from calving to conception.

Researchers have already started automating various activities of the SME workflow. Understanding the requirements for maintenance and development work i.e. Requirements Engineering (RE) is a crucial phase that kicks off the SME workflow through multiple discussions on a proposed scope of work documented in different forms. The RE phase ends with a list of user stories for each unit task and usually created and tracked on a project management tool such as GitHub, Jira, AzurDev, etc. In this research, we collaborated with Bell Mobility to develop a tool ""Geneus"" (Generate UserSory) using GPT-4-turbo to automatically create user stories from software requirements documents. Requirements documents are usually long and contain complex information. Since LLMs typically suffer from hallucination when the input is too complex, this paper proposes a new prompting strategy, ""Refine and Thought"" (RaT), to mitigate that issue and improve the performance of the LLM in prompts with large and noisy contexts. Along with manual evaluation using RUST (Readability, Understandability, Specificity, Technical-aspects) survey questionnaire, automatic evaluation with BERTScore, and AlignScore evaluation metrics are used to evaluate the results of the ""Geneus"" tool. Results show that our method with RaT performs consistently better in most of the cases of interactions compared to the single-shot baseline method.

Expression of cell adhesion molecules by the arterial endothelium may play a major role in atherosclerosis. It has been suggested that antioxidants inhibit the expression of adhesion molecules and may thus attenuate the processes leading to atherosclerosis. In the present study, the effects of a potent water-soluble antioxidant, salvianolic acid B (Sal B), and an aqueous ethanol ic extract (SME), both derived from a Chinese herb, Salvia miltiorrhiza, on the expression of endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecules by tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha)-treated human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs) were investigated. When pretreated with SME (50 and 100 mug/ml), the TNF-alpha -induced expression of vascular adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) was notably attenuated (77.2 +/-3.2% and 80.0 +/-2.2%, respectively); and with Sal B (1, 2 5, 5, 10, and 20 mug/ml), 84.5 +/-1.9%, 78.8 +/-1.2%, 58.9 +/-0.4%, 58.7 +/-0.9%, and 57.4 +/-0.3%, respectively. Dose-dependent lowering of expression of intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) was also seen with SME or Sal B. in contrast, the expression of endothelial cell selectin (E-selectin) was not affected. SME (50 mug/ml) or Sal B (5 mug/ml) significantly reduced the binding of the human monocytic cell line, U937, to TNF-alpha -stimulated HAECs (45.7 +/-2.5% and 55.8 +/-1.2%, respectively). SME or Sal B significantly inhibited TNF-alpha -induced activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) in HAECs (0.36- and 0.48-fold, respectively). These results demonstrate that SME and Sal B have anti-inflammatory properties and may explain their anti-atherosclerotic properties. This new mechanism of action of Sal B and SME, in addition to their previously reported inhibition of LDL, may help explain their efficacy in the treatment of atherosclerosis.

Selenium nanoparticles have attracted a lot of attention because of their various applications and benefits in medicine. This investigation studied a biosynthesis of selenium nanoparticles using Sonchus maritimus leaves aqueous extract (SmE-SeNPs) to evaluate their anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer properties. The presence of SmE-SeNPs in the sample was confirmed by ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectroscopy at different stage of synthesis, and transmission electron microscope. The S. maritimus extract was analyzed by LC-ESI-MS technique. The anti-inflammatory proprieties of the extract and SmE-SeNPs was estimated using protein denaturation and membrane stabilization assays, and the antiproliferative activity of the synthesized nanoparticles was assessed against breast cancer cell line (MCF-7). LC-ESI-MS results revealed the richness of S. maritimus extract by various phenolic compounds including protocachuic acid, trans frulic acid, o-coumaric acid and luteolin. Physical characterizations of nanoparticle demonstrated that the SeNPs have a spherical and regular circle shape with very small size reach to 7.154 +/- 0.47 nm.

To address this issue, we propose a novel shared spatial map network (SSMN), which abstracts EEG data representations from different individuals and electrode layouts. The SSMN utilizes a shared map encoder (SME) to generate EEG feature maps with consistent spatial locations on the scalp. Then, an instance augmentation encoder (IAE) is employed to increase the sample size and filter out individual-specific components. Finally, a workload recognition committee (WRC) is established by combining shallow and deep architectures of convolutional neural networks (ConvNets), allowing for adaptation to different mental workload measurement scenarios. We evaluate SSMN's performance by combining two feature types and four validation approaches on three databases.

However, no report exists on the effect of Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge extract (SME) on MGO-induced glucotoxicity in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). We demonstrated the protective effects of SME (1, 5, and 10 mu g/mL) and its components against MGO-induced endothelial dysfunction in HUVECs. Cytotoxicity was evaluated using the several in vitro experiments. Additionally, the protein expression of receptor of advanced glycation end-products (RAGE), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway and glyoxalase system were measured. Then, the inhibitory effects of SME and its main components on MGO-induced oxidative stress, radical scavenging, formation of MGO-derived advanced glycation end products (AGEs), and MGO-AGEs crosslinking were evaluated. SME (10 mu g/mL) strongly prevented expressed levels of RAGE, MGO-induced apoptosis and reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in HUVECs, comparing with 1 mM aminoguanidine. Additionally, SME (5 and 10 mu g/mL) reduced the expression of proteins (e.g., p-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and p-p38) in the MAPKs pathway and upregulated the glyoxalase system in HUVECs. SME (0.5-10 mg/mL), dihydrotanshinone (0.4 mM), and rosmarinic acid (0.4 mM) prevented MGO-AGEs formation and broke the MGO-AGE crosslinking.

We use language-independent statistical attributes characterising their communication patterns and the content of their posts. In each newspaper, we separately analyse two categories of news (domestic and international). A large majority of participants in each dataset was found to belong to one stable and dominant cluster present in all our datasets. We interpret it as comprising the ""standard"" or ""average"" discussion participants. The remaining participants could be viewed as various kinds of ""anomalies"" or ""departures from normal"" (not necessarily negative) and were assigned to several minor clusters. The shape and position of some minor clusters generalized well across the datasets. Overall, we found significant structural similarities between the four datasets in terms of histograms of attributes, the existence of one stable and dominant cluster, and the similar shape and location of several minor clusters. This is a significant result given that the four datasets were largely independent and the two newspapers adopted radically different policies for dealing with karma and foul language. The proposed approach therefore looks very promising as a means of identifying anomalous behaviour on diverse online discussion platforms. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

In the light of the resource-based view and dominant logic (DL), this study is an endeavor in this regard and proposes that DL and managerial capabilities are intangible resources, which can drive the performance of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). We hypothesized that dynamic managerial capabilities (DMCs), measured by human capital along with social capital and managerial cognition, play a mediating role in the relationship between DL, consisting of proactiveness and routine, and firm performance. The data in this study were obtained through a survey from 204 SMEs in China and were analyzed by structural equation modeling to generate results. We found that while successfully utilizing intangible/operant resources that are characterized as firm dynamic capabilities, SMEs can achieve superior performance and competitive advantage. Our results support the proposed hypotheses that show the importance and significance of DL and DMCs in order to attain higher level of performance.

Third, the coordinate of center point in the series data array is identified from every line scanning. Fourth, every section slope between two nearby center points from the first to last lines is formulated and calculated sequentially. Finally, the square mean error (SME) is used to evaluate the shape defect situation according to all accumulated errors from every slope variation.

Objective: The present study aimed to determine the antioxidative and photocytotoxic effects of CME and SME toward liver cancer cells. Materials and Methods: Cell-based (2', 7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate) and chemical-based (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl [DPPH]) experiments were utilized to determine the antioxidative properties of both herbal extracts. CME and SME were also tested for their photocytotoxic potentials after photodynamic therapy (PDT). Phytochemical analysis was performed to identify the phytocompounds present in the extracts. Results: Both the extracts demonstrated dose-dependent DPPH radical scavenging activities, while SME was found to be a stronger reactive oxygen species scavenger than CME at all concentrations tested on liver cells. Interestingly, on PDT, HepG2 cells treated with SME and CME at nontoxic doses showed a decrease in cellular viability charting half-maximal inhibitory concentration of 13.45 mu g/mL and 81.03 mu g/mL, respectively. Total phenolic content of SME (36.27 +/- 1.31 mg GAE/g extract) was slightly higher than CME (31.76 +/- 0.10 mg GAE/g extract). On the contrary, the total flavonoid content of CME (11.32 +/- 0.28 mg QE/g extract) was approximately seven times more than SME (1.69 +/- 0.03 mg QE/g extract). Phenolic acids, flavonoids, and pheophorbide-a were identified in both extracts. In view of this, these phytocompounds present in CME and SME could lead to the observed beneficial effects.

The physicochemical evaluation revealed that the sonicated beads (CS-SMB) developed a rougher surface with cracks and pores, creating additional adsorption sites. Column studies showed that the optimized process variables for the continuous adsorption of MO onto the CS-SMB are 10 mg/L initial MO concentration, 400 mm bed height, and 20 mL/min flow rate. The MO removal percentage achieved under these optimized conditions slightly outperformed that of the unsonicated beads (i.e. CS-MB). However, the performance of the CS-SMB and CS-MB converged after 10 min probably due to the reduction in bead size and the presence of trapped bubbles within the beads after sonication.

Emerging data indicate that host factors may impact the SME, but the relationship between prediagnostic host factors and SME phenotype remains poorly characterized, particularly among women of African ancestry. Methods: We conducted a case-only analysis involving 792 patients with breast cancer (17-84 years) from the Ghana Breast Health Study. High-accuracy machine-learning algorithms were applied to standard H&E-stained images to characterize SME phenotypes [including percent tumor-associated connective tissue stroma, Ta-CTS (%); tumor-associated stromal cellular density, Ta-SCD (%)]. Associations between prediagnostic host factors and SME phenotypes were assessed in multivariable linear regression models. Results: Decreasing Ta-CTS and increasing Ta-SCD were associated with aggressive, mostly high-grade tumors (P-value < 0.001). Several prediagnostic host factors were associated with Ta-SCD independently of tumor characteristics. Compared with nulliparous women, parous women had higher levels of Ta-SCD [mean (standard deviation, SD) = 31.3% (7.6%) vs. 28.9% (7.1%); P-value = 0.01]. Similarly, women with a positive family history of breast cancer had higher levels of Ta-SCD than those without family history [mean (SD) = 33.0% (7.5%)] vs. 30.9% (7.6%); P-value = 0.03]. Conversely, increasing body size was associated with decreasing Ta-SCD [mean (SD) = 31.6% (7.4%), 31.4% (7.3%), and 30.1% (8.0%) for slight, average, and large body sizes, respectively; P-value = 0.005].

Herein, a label-free molecular beacons-based DNA machine was developed for sensitive detection of telomerase activity. The DNA machine consisted of T7 exonuclease (T7 Exo), label-free recognition molecular beacon (RMB) and signal molecular beacon (SMB) with projecting 5'-terminuses, which can protect RMB and SMB from being digested by T7 Exo. Firstly, telomerase elongated telomerase substrate (TS) primer, generating a telomerase elongation production (TEP) with tandem repeats (TTAGGG)(n). Next, TEP activated the DNA machine by hybridizing with RMB, unfolding RMB with a recessed 5'-terminus, making RMB deprotection from T7 Exo. Then T7 Exo-assisted cycling cleavage was incurred, releasing intact TEP and numerous DNA fragments (trigger DNA), which got recycling I. Subsequently, trigger DNA specifically opened SMB and was recycled by T7 Exo, liberating multiple G-quadruplex (G4) structures, which got recycling II. Finally, TEP and the liberative G4 structures strongly interacted with N-methyl-mesoporphyrin LX (NMM), yielding a significantly enhanced fluorescence together. In this way, per telomerase-mediated elongation event was efficiently converted into the greatly amplified fluorescence signals. Telomerase activity in crude HeLa cells extracts equivalent to 50 cells/mL was successfully measured with a linear range from 50 cells/mL to 2000 cells/mL.

Using a stratified random sample of 385 firms from the most representative economic sectors, a survey instrument was designed to assess three dimensions: access to AI-enabling conditions, degree of AI utilization, and organizational characteristics. The results reveal that AI adoption remains limited and highly concentrated in marketing-related functions, particularly in content generation and social media automation, with minimal implementation in finance, logistics, and human resource management. The study also identifies the main barriers hindering AI adoption. The lack of qualified professionals and the unavailability of structured databases emerged as the most critical obstacles, followed by limited financial capacity. One-way ANOVA and Kruskal–Wallis tests confirmed significant differences in AI adoption levels based on company size and sector, especially in areas such as inventory optimization and design prototyping. These findings highlight a gap between the potential of AI technologies and their real-world implementation in Ecuadorian MSMEs.

Modern businesses utilize AI systems to optimize their operations, make strategic decisions and to enhance quality etc. On the other hand, Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) constitute a sizeable portion of the global economy and are the main drivers of economic development. The highly saturated market of SMEs demands them to adopt innovative digital technologies to stay competitive. However, there are various challenges including ethics, transparency, privacy, biases, financial limitations, infrastructural incapacity, and others associated with the adoption of AI. Most SMEs are unable to measure AI readiness since it is a multi-faceted procedure that requires developing a multidimensional construct with variable elements. Therefore, this work proposes a Technology-Organization-Environment-Human (TOEH) framework that comprehensively captures the possible dimensions of AI readiness and their related elements. The model carries out this evaluation at the micro level by assessing the attributes of all dimensional elements for each of the four dimensions. In the pr-assessment phase, severity index for each attribute of the dimensional elements is formulated through expert review that serves as a metric to assess AI readiness. In the assessment phase, firm's capabilities are identified through a comprehensive questionnaire and each of the dimensional elements is assigned a readiness state (informal, struggling, approaching and desirable state). Based upon the state of these dimensional elements and the pre-determined severity ratings, a readiness rating is assigned to the four dimensions. The proposed model is also capable of suggesting a comprehensive action plan based on the organizational inadequacies. It is iterative that requires SMEs to reassess their readiness until it achieve the desired or required readiness state.  © 2025 The Authors.

So, we propose SME-MFP, a novel predictor in the imbalanced multi-label functional peptide datasets. First, we employ physicochemical and evolutionary information to represent the peptide sequence's initialization features from multiple perspectives. Second, the features are fused and then put into spatial feature extractors, where the residual connection and multiscale convolutional neural network extract more discriminative features of different lengths’ peptide sequences. Besides, we also design AFT-based temporal feature extractors to fully capture the global interactions of the sequences. Finally, devising a new loss to replace the traditional cross entropy loss to settle the class imbalance problems.

Due to a lack of capacity and expertise, SMEs are unable to adequately fulfil this reporting requirement. A significant degree of automation is required to enable SMEs to efficiently comply with reporting. Recent advances in generative AI entails potentials to overcome several technical challenges inter alia i) heterogeneity of data, ii) necessary semantic intelligence, iii) usability requirements, and iv) assuring quality and reproducibility of automatically generated reports. This paper proposes a novel AI framework for automating sustainability reporting, thus assisting sustainability managers. It uses a hybrid approach incorporating knowledge graphs (KG) and large language models (LLM). Firstly, the EU taxonomy is converted into a Taxonomy-KG that specifies required KPIs and identifies target sources for data collection, thus retrieving necessary information for feeding KPIs. Subsequently, the Taxonomy KG guides an LLM to extract relevant information from corporate data, thereby enabling the EU Taxonomy reporting. By feeding the KPIs, a sustainability manager chatbot automatically generates an EU taxonomy report. © The Author(s) 2025.",,10.1007/978-3-031-93891-7_7,Corporate Sustainability;Generative AI;Knowledge Graph;Reporting;SMEs;Sustainable Development Goals;Economics;Knowledge graph;Sustainable development goals;Taxonomies;Corporate-sustainability;Economic activities;Enterprise IS;Generative AI;Global sustainability;Knowledge graphs;Language model;Reporting;SME;Sustainability reporting;Sustainable development,,,,,True,"The article discusses the use of AI, specifically generative AI and knowledge graphs, by SMEs to automate sustainability reporting, which aligns with investigating AI adoption and its benefits and challenges in SME operations."

It critically examines various stakeholders, their barriers and drivers, and the difficulties in benchmarking and verifying energy savings in SMEs’ energy efficiency projects. By addressing these issues, the paper proposes integrating drivers into one sustainable business model. It maps them in a triple-layer business canvas model (TLBCM) to highlight the comprehensive value proposition of utilising these drivers in an integrated way. This new business model is strategically designed to address economic, environmental, and social aspects of energy efficiency, making it a robust solution for SMEs. Economically, it reduces financial burdens by creating innovative financing mechanisms and dual revenue streams from energy sales and savings. Environmentally, it advocates for producing and using green energy at SME locations, contributing to the sector’s decarbonization. Socially, the model fosters trust and collaboration among stakeholders, enhancing the commitment to energy-saving practices and generating significant social benefits. By offering a structured approach that combines economic viability with environmental responsibility and social impact, this model emerges as a pioneering solution in the European energy efficiency market, highlighting the importance of data mining to develop digital platforms that can enhance feasibility, cost-benefit analysis, lifecycle analysis, environmental impact assessment and benchmarking capabilities for micro and macro energy efficiency projects utilising the proposed TLBCM. This facilitates sustainable energy efficiency practices among SMEs and can set a benchmark for future energy efficiency initiatives, demonstrating the effectiveness of integrated approaches in achieving sustainable development goals. This paper contributes to the field by proposing a novel TLBCM for an integrated approach to address the multifaceted challenges in the SME energy efficiency sector.

However, SMEs in this sector face recurring problems due to their low levels of preparedness, making demand fluctuations a latent threat. Food and beverage service SMEs suffer from inadequate inventory management, inaccurate supply planning and a lack of process optimization, which leads to a low level of On Time in Full (OTIF) deliveries. This is detrimental to an SME, as customer satisfaction is crucial in this sector. Due to this, the present study proposes an innovative Lean Management model that integrates 5S tools and Machine Learning to increase OTIF in a Peruvian beverage service SME. The research focuses on the Milk Tea and Smoothie product lines, which exhibited stockouts and high preparation and stock review times through analysis and diagnosis. The proposed model results in a reduction of 75.98% in the total cycle time of an order. Additionally, the implementation of Machine Learning helped reduce stockouts by providing a more accurate supply forecast, improving forecast error by 19.72% and 38.71% for tapioca and milk, respectively. These indicators led to a 51.42% increase in OTIF. Thus, this management model effectively innovates by adapting tools often used for manufacturing and production to the services sector, thereby achieving outstanding results in both efficiency and customer satisfaction. © 2025 Seventh Sense Research Group®",,10.14445/22315381/IJETT-V73I3P140,Beverage industry;Enterprise resource planning;Inventory management;Lean management;Machine learning,,,,,True,"The article discusses the use of Machine Learning in a Peruvian SME to improve inventory management and operational efficiency, directly aligning with the research focus on AI/ML adoption in SMEs and its impact on performance and competitiveness."

Furthermore, the stability issue is of crucial importance in relation to training algorithms adjusting the parameters of neural networks. If the predictor is unstable for certain choices of neural model parameters, serious numerical problems can occur during training. Stability criteria should be universal, applicable to as broad a class of systems as possible and at the same time computationally efficient. The majority of well-known approaches are based on Lyapunov's method [163, 77, 164, 165, 166, 167]. Fang and Kincaid applied the matrix measure technique to study global exponential stability of asymmetrical Hopfield type networks [168]. Jin et. al [169] derived sufficient conditions for absolute stability of a general class of discrete-time recurrent networks by using Ostrowski's theorem. Recently, global asymptotic as well exponential stability conditions for discrete-time recurrent networks with globally Lipschitz continuous and monotone nondecreasing activation functions were introduced by Hu and Wang [170]. The existence and uniqueness of an equilibrium were given as a matrix determinant problem. Unfortunately, most of the existing results do not consider the stabilization of the network during training. They allow checking the stability of the neural model only after training it. Literature about the stabilization of neural network during training is rather scarce. Jin and Gupta proposed two training methods for a discrete-time dynamic network: multiplier and constrained learning rate algorithms. Both algorithms utilized stability conditions derived by using Lyapunov's first method and Gersgorin's theorem. In turn, Suykens et al. [172] derived stability conditions for recurrent multi-layer network using linearisation, robustness analysis of linear systems under non-linear perturbations and matrix inequalities. The elaborated conditions have been used to constrain the dynamic backpropagation algorithm. These solutions, however, are devoted to globally recurrent networks. © 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",,10.1007/978-3-540-79872-9_5,"Algorithms;Aluminum;Artificial intelligence;Asymptotic stability;Backpropagation;Backpropagation algorithms;Computer networks;Continuous time systems;Control system stability;Control theory;Dynamical systems;Dynamics;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Electric fault currents;Evolutionary algorithms;Function evaluation;Identification (control systems);Learning algorithms;Linear matrix inequalities;Linear stability analysis;Linear systems;Mathematical models;Matrix algebra;Mechanics;Metropolitan area networks;Model checking;Network protocols;Neural networks;Numerical methods;Parameter estimation;Robust control;Stabilization;System stability;Telecommunication networks;Vegetation;(e ,2e) theory;(I ,J) conditions;(Liquid + liquid) equilibrium;(SIM+SME) training method;absolute stability;Applied (CO);Artificial neural network (ANNs);Computationally efficient;Discrete time (DT);Dynamic back propagation;Existence and uniqueness;Exponential stability;Fault diagnosis (FD);General class;Global exponential stability (GES);Globally Lipschitz;Heidelberg (CO);Hopfield;Learning rates;Lyapunov;Matrix determinant;Matrix inequalities;Matrix measures;Monotone nondecreasing activation functions;Multi layer networks;Neural modeling;Non-linear;Numerical problems;Recurrent networks;Robustness analysis;Springer (CO);stability conditions;Sufficient conditions (SC);System identification (SI);Technical processing;Training algorithms;Stability criteria",,,,,False,The article focuses on stability issues in neural network training algorithms rather than the adoption and impact of AI technologies in SMEs' operations.

Additionally, we also investigate attitudes and dispositions towards voluntary codes of conduct as outlined within it. This study aims to shed light on the operational, regulatory, and ethical dimensions of AI integration within SMEs. It reveals that SMEs favor third-party AI systems, particularly those based on Large Language Models (LLMs), due to their convenience and minimal integration effort. Additionally, SMEs are keenly aware of their need for external support to navigate upcoming AI regulations, emphasizing the importance of tailored interventions to ensure compliance and optimal use of AI technologies. Lastly, SMEs view voluntary codes of conduct as outlined in the AI Act as a testament to a company's commitment to go beyond mere legal compliance, thus reinforcing trust.

This has an impact on the emergence of many business actors in the e-commerce field which brings its own challenges to stay alive and face the competition. The demands for innovation in competitive competition are also increasingly diverse with various approaches ranging from technology, social science, management science and even artificial intelligence. One form of innovation that is widely carried out by e-commerce today is looking for an ideal and effective form of marketing, where the form of marketing itself is considered less able to accommodate e-commerce needs. One form of real innovation in finding the ideal and effective marketing is with precision marketing. Precision marketing itself is marketing that is carried out by utilizing data where consumers are the center of preference for data collection. In fact, many e-commerce companies that were launched were unable to keep up with the competition because they were unable to develop marketing strategies and eventually went bankrupt. Therefore, we need a special way to bridge these problems so that e-commerce can stay alive, especially for e-commerce classified as Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs).

A robust legal framework is essential as AI enterprises navigate issues like algorithmic bias, misinformation, privacy violations, and regulatory inconsistencies. This paper examines how business structures—Godo-Kaisha in Japan and Limited Liability Companies (LLCs) and Series LLCs in the U.S.—shape liability exposure and corporate governance in AI enterprises. A key contribution of this study is its focus on legal structures as a foundation for AI’s social implementation. Granting legal status to AI service businesses enables the assignment of rights and obligations, ensuring effective risk allocation, governance, and regulatory compliance. This highlights the interaction between business law and AI governance in fostering responsible innovation. Through comparative legal analysis, this paper explores how liability structures influence AI governance, corporate accountability, and ethical compliance. It examines the EU AI Act’s dual-axis risk classification and emerging governance models such as the OECD AI Principles and the G7 Hiroshima AI Process, with Series LLCs proposed as a novel approach to fluctuating AI risks.

The study used a structured questionnaire and convenience sampling. Using data from 288 managers, it identifies both positive and negative perspectives on AI within a sector undergoing digital transformation. The findings reveal quite balanced attitudes, with both positive and negative experiences being recognized, though there is a slight tendency towards a more negative perspective. Managers’ DC play a more significant role in shaping attitudes than SMEs’ PC. Younger and less experienced managers tend to be more optimistic and enthusiastic about AI adoption, while older and more experienced managers are generally more sceptical. Family-owned businesses, which represent 61% of the sample, recognize some of AI’s potential benefits but primarily express more concerns about its use compared to non-family-owned businesses. SMEs with more employees and those operating in more competitive environments demonstrate a stronger propensity to adopt AI. This study highlights key barriers to AI adoption in hospitality SMEs, emphasizing the need for targeted education and training programmes, particularly for older managers and those with limited exposure to digital (AI) tools. Promoting awareness of AI’s benefits through practical demonstrations and best practice examples can reduce resistance and foster more positive attitudes. By addressing these challenges, the hospitality sector can enhance its digital transformation in an increasingly technology-driven environment. © 2025 University of Primorska.

The COVID-19 global crisis has accelerated the cyberfication of systems and services. The move to digital platforms has afforded SMMEs opportunities to offer their services to a broader geographical area. However, this has also presented opportunities for cybercriminals to invade the digital infrastructure. Adopting digital transformation has put SMMEs in a vulnerable position since they need to manage their cybersecurity while lacking the necessary skills and ICT infrastructure. The inability of SMMEs to defend themselves against cyberattacks compels them to outsource their security needs to external security service providers. These external security service providers offer security services based on a hierarchical operating model. Essential security services are offered at a lower level. If the paying clients require advanced security services, they may be provided as an add-on to the contractual agreement resulting in additional cost. This paper explores the active cyber defence (ACD) approach to enhance cybersecurity defence while minimising service costs. Therefore, the primary objective and outcome of this paper are to identify some of the essential drivers that will contribute towards developing the active cyber defence framework for SMMEs in developing countries. For purposes of clarity, essential drivers are the gaps highlighted during the literature review and will be referred to as ""essential drivers"" throughout the paper. The essential drivers, together with suggested recommendations, will be consolidated. The essential drivers were drawn from existing literature by going through peer-reviewed academic papers and company whitepapers. To achieve the primary objective, we need to establish whether SMMEs are utilising the services of external security service providers. The external security service providers will be referred to as ""Security Operation Centre-SOC as a service"" throughout the paper. The secondary objective of this paper is to determine whether SMMEs are utilising the SOC as a service and if they do, whether they realise value for money. © 2023 Curran Associates Inc..

Both systems use the Waters XBridge C18 adsorbent of 10 mu m particle diameter. The screening of the mobile phase composition elected the 30:70:0.1 (v/v/v) ethanol:water:diethylamine solvent mixture to perform both FB and SMB preparative operations.A large set of experimental, modelling and simulation results are presented, including pulses, measurement and modelling of the adsorption equilibrium isotherms, and its validation through breakthroughs measurements. The modelling and simulation steps allowed the prediction and the optimization of both the FB and SMB operating conditions.For FB, using a feed concentration of 9 g/L of an equimolar mixture of the two nadolol racemates, both were recovered almost pure (at least 99.9 %), with a global system productivity of 3.06 gfeed/(Lbed.hr) and a solvent consumption of 4.21 Lsolvent/gfeed. For SMB, the pilot unit's pressure drops limits imposed a maximum internal flow-rate of only 5 mL/min and, for a nadolol feed concentration of 2 g/L, both racemates were recovered 100 % pure, with a system productivity of 0.13 gfeed/(Lbed.hr) and a solvent consumption of 6.19 Lsolvent/gfeed. Addi-tional simulation results showed that a SMB preparative unit can perform the 9 g/L nadolol racemate separation with a system productivity of 3.61 gfeed/(Lbed.hr) and a solvent consumption of only 1.95 Lsolvent/gfeed using the same average internal flow-rate as in FB operation. Even better SMB productivities can still be obtained using the same feed or solvent flow-rates as in FB operation if the internal SMB flow-rates are allowed and not limited by the system pressure drop.The experimental results presented in this work validate the strategy of separating a four nadolol stereoiso-mers mixture into two pure nadolol racemates, each one composed by a pair of nadolol enantiomers, using an achiral C18 adsorbent through FB and SMB chromatographic techniques.

To enhance our understanding of the genetic markers associated with psychrotolerance (defined here as > 1 log(10) increase in cfu/mL after 21 days incubation at 6 degrees C) among dairy-associated B. cereus group isolates, we used genetic (whole genome sequencing) and phenotypic methods [growth in Skim Milk Broth (SMB) and Brain Heart Infusion (BHI) broth] to characterize 23 genetically-distinct representative isolates from a collection of 503 dairy-associated isolates. Quality threshold clustering identified three categories of psychrotolerance: (i) 14 isolates that were not psychrotolerant in BHI or SMB, (ii) 6 isolates that were psychrotolerant in BHI but not in SMB, and (iii) 2 isolates that were psychrotolerant in BHI and SMB. One isolate, which was psychrotolerant in BHI broth but was just below the cut-off of > 1 log(10) cfu/mL increase in SMB was not assigned to a cluster. A maximum likelihood phylogeny constructed with core genome single nucleotide polymorphisms classified all psychrotolerant isolates (i.e., psychrotolerant in BHI) into Glade VI (representing B. mycoides/weihenstephanensis). Analysis of correlations between gene ortholog presence or absence patterns and psychrotolerance identified 206 orthologous gene clusters that were significantly overrepresented among psychrotolerant strains, including two clusters of cold shock proteins, which were identified in 8/9 and 7/9 psychrotolerant isolates. Gene ontology analyses revealed 36 gene ontology terms that were overrepresented in psychrotolerant isolates, including putrescine catabolic processes and putrescine transmembrane transporter activity. Lastly, Hidden Markov Model searches identified three protein family motifs, including cold shock domain proteins and fatty acid hydroxylases that were significantly associated with psychrotolerance in BHI broth. Analyses of CspA sequences revealed a positive association between psychrotolerant strains and a previously identified ""psychrotolerant"" CspA sequence. Overall, our data highlight genetic and phenotypic differences in psychrotolerance among B. cereus group dairy-associated isolates and show that psychrotolerance is dependent on the growth medium. We also identified a number of gene targets that could be used for specific detection or control of psychrotolerant B. cereus group isolates.",,10.3389/fmicb.2019.00662     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Bacillus cereus;whole genome sequencing;psychrotolerant;spoilage;skim milk broth;PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSIS;MAILLARD REACTION;SP NOV.;GENOME;IDENTIFICATION;WEIHENSTEPHANENSIS;STRAINS;FOODS;PATHOGENICITY;PREVALENCE,,,,,False,"The article focuses on genetic and phenotypic analysis of Bacillus cereus group related to psychrotolerance in dairy isolates, with no mention of AI, ML, DL, ANN, or their use in SMEs or organizational performance."

First, objects with significant scale differences exist in one scene simultaneously, so it is generally difficult for the detectors to balance the detection performance of large and small objects. Second, because of the complex background and the objects' densely distributed characteristics in the remote sensing images, the extracted features usually have noise and blurred boundaries, which interfere with the detection performance of the object detectors. With this observation, we propose an end-to-end scale-aware network called feature split-merge-enhancement network (SME-Net) for remote sensing object detection, composed of the feature split-and-merge (FSM) module, the offset-error rectification (OER) module, and the object saliency enhancement (OSE) strategy. FSM eliminates salient information of large objects to highlight the features of small objects in the shallow feature maps. It also transmits the effective detailed features of large objects to the deep feature maps, alleviating feature confusion between multiscale objects. OER corrects the inconsistency of the features spatial layout among the multilayer feature maps by the proposed offset loss, so as to achieve supervised elimination and transmission in FSM. OSE enhances the features of interests and suppresses the background information by the proposed membership function, thus preventing false detection and missed detection caused by noise and blurred boundaries. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm has been verified on multiple datasets.

Design/methodology/approachThis study employed a survey method to collect data from 225 food processing small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) on the Ghana Enterprise Agency (GEA) registered list in the Eastern Region of Ghana. The effect of marketing modification on the performance of SMEs in the food processing industry was evaluated using a structural equation modeling (SEM) - path analysis. FindingsAccording to the study's findings, marketing modification has a positive and significant impact on the financial performance (FP), customer performance (CP), internal business process performance (IBPP) and learning and growth performance (LGP) of Ghanaian SMEs engaged in food processing. The results of this study also demonstrated the importance of marketing modification determinants, such as marketing resources (MR), cross-functional and interenterprise collaboration (CFIEC), architectural marketing capability (AMC) and marketing strategy decision implementation (MSDI), in achieving food processing SME performance in Ghana. Research limitations/implicationsThis current research has its limitation, even though its importance has been mentioned earlier. First, the study can be improved by expanding the sample size through the inclusion of other SMEs from other industries since it is industry specific (i.e. food processing SME). Second, this current study was conducted in Ghana. To compare results, the current study may be replicated in other emerging countries. Third, future research studies may consider how business environmental factors such as technological change (e.g. use of artificial intelligence and machine learning) moderate the relationship between marketing modification and SME performance. Practical implicationsThe outcomes of this research study are anticipated to give profitable implications to both academicians and practitioners. For the academic aspect, this study provides an important contribution to marketing modification and performance literature by examining the impact of innovative marketing on the performance of food processing SMEs in Ghana. For practitioners, this study indicates that food processing SME owners/managers must focus on marketing modification to develop their performance. The increase in marketing modification application through marketing capabilities such as MR and CFIEC will enable owners/managers to achieve performance targets. Social implicationsThe application of marketing modification among food processing SMEs in Ghana will contribute greatly to their profitability, survival and growth. The growth and survival of food processing SMEs (not limited to food processing SMEs) in Ghana will help in the control of unemployment, which is a major social issue in Ghana. Originality/valueThe study's findings provide solid support for the marketing capabilities theory. This study also supports the notion that food processing SMEs should perceive marketing modification and its determinants (i.e. MR, CFIEC, AMC and MSDI) as a critical strategic capacity to enhance their performance (i.e. FP, CF, IBPP and LGP).

This study proposes an extrapolative collaborative filtering (ECF) system that does not directly share data among SMEs but improves recommendation performance for small and medium-sized companies that lack data through the extrapolation of data, which can provide a magical experience to users. Previously, recommendations were made utilizing only data generated by the merchant itself, so it was impossible to recommend goods to new users. However, our ECF system provides appropriate recommendations to new users as well as existing users based on privacy-preserved payment transaction data. To accomplish this, PP2Vec using Word2Vec was developed by utilizing purchase information only, excluding personal information from payment company data. We then compared the performances of single-merchant models and multi-merchant models. For the merchants with more data than SMEs, the performance of the single-merchant model was higher, while for the SME merchants with fewer data, the multi-merchant model's performance was higher. The ECF System proposed in this study is more suitable for the real-world business environment because it does not directly share data among companies.

The LTM fast GC is based on a short capillary column inserted inside a stainless steel tube that is resistively heated. It is located and mounted outside the standard GC oven on its available top detector port, while the capillary column is connected as usual to the standard GC injector and supersonic molecular beam interface transfer line. This new type of fast GC-MS with SMB enables less than 1 min full range temperature programming and cooling down analysis cycle time. The operation of the fast GC-MS with SMB was explored and 1 min full analysis cycle time of a mixture of 16 hydrocarbons in the C10H22 up to C44H90 range was achieved. The use of 35 mL/min high column flow rate enabled the elution of C44H90 in less than 45s while the SMB interface enabled splitless acceptance of this high flow rate and the provision of dominant molecular ions. A novel compound 9-benzylazidanthracene was analyzed for its purity and a synthetic chemistry process was monitored for the optimization of the chemical reaction yield.

Design/methodology - First of all, this paper explored the prior research, the current status of sales support for SMEs, and the changes in the distribution industry due to COVID-19 pandemic. Based on Moon (2016)'s ABCD strategic model - Agility, Benchmarking, Convergence, and Dedication, the study then derived directions in which official distribution channels should move and the new distribution strategy for Korean SMEs to secure competitive advantage.        Findings - First, in terms of 'Agility', in order to upgrade official distribution channels, which are currently at some competitive disadvantages compared to private distribution companies, we must quickly introduce technologies for the 4th industrial revolution, such as AI, Big Data, etc., and establish precise strategies to strengthen the capabilities of SMEs. Second, in terms of `Benchmarking', the use of ""Chamelezones"" has been increasing to enhance the competitiveness of offline stores in line with recent ontact trends. Therefore, official distribution channels should also benchmark such cases, strengthening their competitiveness by utilizing offline spaces more efficiently and effectively. Third, in terms of 'Convergence', in line with the rapidly changing trend of the times, official distribution channels should also promote active partnerships with media commerce, e-commerce and ICT platforms, as well as cooperation with private retailers, and focus on creating synergy effects through them. Finally, from the perspective of 'Dedication', digitalization should be promoted step by step, finding the sector that can accelerate digital among the value chains of official distribution channels, and continuing to discuss how to digitize it realistically.        Originality/value - Based on this analysis, we have presented strategies and implications for innovating official distribution channels for SMEs, which will contribute to enhancing the competitive advantage of official distribution channels in the post COVID-19 pandemic era.",,10.35611/jkt.2021.25.3.153     WE  - Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),ABCD Model;Korean SME;New Distribution Strategies;Official Distribution Channels,,,,,True,"The article discusses the adoption of AI and related technologies by SMEs to enhance distribution strategies and competitiveness, aligning with the research focus on AI use in SME operations and its impact on performance."

However, the effects of the isolated major components of SMB on osseous cells and their corresponding effective doses are still unclear. In the present study, the effects of three components of SMB, including tanshinone IIA (Ts), salvianolic acid B (salB) and protocatechuic aldehyde (Pca), on mesenchymal bone marrow cells with the potential for osteoblastic differentiation were investigated.        Various concentrations of Ts, salB and Pea were added to a rat bone marrow cell culture. The total metabolic activity and differentiation of bone marrow cells were evaluated by a metabolic assay and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, respectively. The morphology and number of cells was observed by phase contrast microscopy and fluorescent microscopy after propidium iodide staining, respectively.        Ts suppressed the growth and differentiation of bone precursor cells. SalB exhibited a biphasic effect: the high concentration of 160 mu g/mL significantly depressed the population of bone marrow cells, however, lower concentrations (3-80 mu g/mL) enhanced the total metabolic activity and their ALP expression. Pea suppressed the bone marrow cell population in a dose-dependent manner. Therefore, SalB has the potential to ameliorate bone healing by stimulating both the total metabolic activity and ALP activity of osteoblastic cells. Aqueous extracts, which preferably contain salB over Pca and are free of Ts therefore are recommended for bone formation. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Time-killing assays revealed its concentration-dependent bactericidal activity against Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 (E. coli ATCC 25922), Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213 (S. aureus ATCC 29213), and Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae S6 (APP S6) after 4 h of treatment at concentrations above the MIC. Halicin exhibited longer post-antibiotic effects (PAEs) and sub-MIC effects (PA-SMEs) for E. coli 25922, S. aureus 29213, and APP S6 compared to ceftiofur and ciprofloxacin, the commonly used veterinary antimicrobial agents, indicating sustained antibacterial action. Additionally, the results of consecutive passaging experiments over 40 d at sub-inhibitory concentrations showed that bacteria exhibited difficulty in developing resistance to halicin. Toxicology studies confirmed that halicin exhibited low acute toxicity, being non-mutagenic, non-reproductive-toxic, and non-genotoxic. Blood biochemical results suggested that halicin has no significant impact on hematological parameters, liver function, and kidney function. Furthermore, halicin effectively treated respiratory A. pleuropneumoniae infections in murine models. These results underscore the potential of halicin as a new antibacterial agent with applications against clinically relevant pathogens in veterinary medicine.",,10.3390/antibiotics13060492     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),halicin;pathogenic bacteria;veterinary medicine;PAE;PA-SME;toxicity;in vitro and in vivo antibacterial efficacy;ACTINOBACILLUS-PLEUROPNEUMONIAE;ANTIMICROBIAL RESISTANCE;STAPHYLOCOCCUS-AUREUS;IN-VITRO;BIOFILM FORMATION;MUTAGENICITY;MICRONUCLEUS;ASSAY;AMES,,,,,False,"The article focuses on AI-identified drug discovery for antimicrobial purposes, not on the use of AI/ML/DL/ANN in SME operations or their organizational performance and competitiveness."

While generalization in statistical learning theory originally refers to the model's ability to generalize well on unseen testing data drawn from the same distribution as that of the training data, we show that good generalization capability is also desirable for mismatched cases. One way to obtain such general models is to use margin-based model training method, e. g., soft-margin estimation (SME), to enable some tolerance to acoustic mismatches without a detailed knowledge about the distortion mechanisms through enhancing margins between competing models. Experimental results on the Aurora-2 and Aurora-3 connected digit string recognition tasks demonstrate that, by improving the model's generalization capability through SME training, speech recognition performance can be significantly improved in both matched and low to medium mismatched testing cases with no language model constraints. Recognition results show that SME indeed performs better with than without mean and variance normalization, and therefore provides a complimentary benefit to conventional feature normalization techniques such that they can be combined to further improve the system performance.

While the drivers and barriers to AI adoption have been extensively studied, there is a lack of scientific publications on AI adoption in digital marketing (DM) among Malaysian SMEs. This study examines how perceived usefulness (PU), perceived ease-of-use (PEOU), and perceived barriers (PB) influence the intention to adopt AI in Malaysian SMEs.

PB significantly hinders adoption, indicating the need to address technological, organizational, and market challenges. The weak but significant relationship between PU and PEOU suggests that businesses do not necessarily equate ease of use with usefulness, implying that AI solutions should be marketed based on their tangible business value rather than just user-friendliness.

Small and medium enterprises in particular confront issues, such as insufficiency of devising strategic planning, strategic decision-making, and information exchange, as well as difficulty increasing performance. Because functional strategic management and decision-making are required, strategic information systems planning is employed to accumulate information and assist decision-makers in developing and implementing the best strategy for gaining superior performance. Executives in information systems focus on technical difficulties while ignoring decisions to support strategic plans. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this article is to investigate how strategic information systems planning contributes to increased performance in SMEs. METHODS: Data was gathered through questionnaires distributed to information system executives in SMEs, primarily in Jordan. The data was collected with the help of questionnaires adopted from prior studies. For Analysis after applying the diagnostic tests, structural equation modelling has been applied to test the framework developed based on the literature. RESULTS: A structural equation modeling (SEM) was conducted, the individual loadings of the SEM items are investigated, reliability and discriminant validity is tested, and path coefficients of hypothesized relationships of the developed model are tested.

Still, retail SMEs are not using AI as much as big corporations even though the technology is more accessible. This paper studies the factors that prevent companies from adopting AI by using the TOE framework which has been extended to cover data-related problems (TOE-D). A thorough look at the literature finds that the main factors behind resisting adoption are technological (for example, missing explanation and risks in security), organizational (lack of resources and the right people), environmental (uncertainty in rules and ethics) and data-related (low-quality data and weak governance). This demonstrates that adopting AI in retail SMEs involves many factors, including things within the company and factors from outside. It wraps up by providing a summary of how adoption happens and it recommends ways for practitioners, policymakers and researchers to come up with solutions. It helps advance the discussion about digital transformation in SMEs by supplying a useful framework for future research and use of AI. © 2025, Academic Science Publications and Distributions.

The associated increase in data volume offers enormous potential for analyzing and optimizing processes. Data from a variety of devices and systems increases the need for intelligent, dynamic analysis models. However, SMEs have a low to very low degree of digitalization. This is the result of a combination of various factors, such as scarce financial and human resources for research and development activities, lack of IT expertise, and a reluctance to introduce new digital technologies and artificial intelligence. Furthermore, the production processes of processing SMEs are very individual and sometimes highly specialized, so existing AI modules cannot be adapted to the existing production structure without increased adaptation effort. As part of this doctoral project, two machine learning methods were developed for practical use in a processing SME. The aim was to identify connections between energy consumption and plastic scrap and the machine settings as well as to find optimal parameter settings to increase energy efficiency and reduce the waste rate. The focus was on the simplicity of the solution and the easy adaptability to changing production processes. It could be shown that significant increases in productivity can also be achieved with less complex AI processes, the selection of which is based on a clear definition of goals. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.",,10.1007/978-3-031-85284-8_6,Artificial Intelligence (AI);Artificial Neural Network (ANN);Machine Learning (ML);Random Forest (RF);Resource Efficiency;Small and medium-sized enterprises (SME),,,,,True,"The article discusses the development and application of machine learning methods in SMEs to optimize production processes, directly addressing AI adoption, benefits, and challenges in SME operations."

The notion of fun, as one of the most peculiar and core aspects of game experience, has often been modeled and quantified for the purpose of content generation with varying success. Recently, measures of a player's fun have been ad-hoc designed to model moderate levels of in-game divergence in platformer games, inspired by Koster's theory of fun. Such measures have shaped the reward functions of game content generative methods following the experience-driven procedural content generation via reinforcement learning (EDRL) paradigm in Super Mario Bros In this article, we present a comprehensive user study involving over 90 participants with a dual purpose: to evaluate the ad-hoc fun metrics introduced in the literature and test the effectiveness of the EDRL framework to generate personalized fun Super Mario Bros experiences in an online fashion. Our key findings suggest that moderate degrees of game level and gameplay divergence are highly consistent with the perceived notion of fun of our participants, cross-verifying the ad-hoc designed fun metrics. On the other hand, it appears that EDRL generators manage to match the preferred (i.e., fun) game experiences of each persona, only in part and for some players. Our findings suggest that the use of multifaceted in-game data, such as events and actions, will likely enable the modeling of more nuanced gameplay behaviors. In addition, the verification of player persona modeling and the enhancement of player engagement through dynamic experience modelling are suggested as potential future directions. © 2018 IEEE.",,10.1109/TG.2024.3456101,Experience modeling;platformer games;procedural content generation (PCG);Super Mario Bros (SMB);user study;Adversarial machine learning;Reinforcement learning;Computational modelling;Experience modeling;Game contents;Game experience;Gameplay;Platformer game;Player experience;Procedural content generations;Super Mario Bros;User study;Digital elevation model,,,,,False,"The article focuses on computational modeling of player experience and game content generation, not on the use of AI/ML/DL/ANN in SMEs or their organizational performance and competitiveness."

Companies must develop both: innovative and targeted solutions to meet these environmental demands. These goes straight ahead with increasing urgency to improve the sustainability of companies' value creation activities. This urgency is reinforced by political measures, such as the introduction of extensive reporting obligations, which aim to make companies sustainability practices transparent and monitorable to external stakeholders. This paper therefore presents a systematic approach for the sustainable development of our production ecosystem with a focus on small and medium-sized manufacturing companies. The aim is to conserve the valuable resources of companies through a smart, AI-supported and digitalised consulting service. The presented framework aims to generate an output that will allow companies to focus on fine-tuning and context-specific implementation of results at an operational level. The EU's upcoming voluntary small and medium-sized enterprises reporting standard (VSME), is concepted to help small and medium-sized enterprises (SME) to record their sustainability goals and improve stakeholder communication. From 2025, the modular standard will be divided into three parts: Basic information on sustainability, detailed targets and measures (PAT), and requirements for business partners for better financing conditions. This includes the fulfilment of reporting obligations as well as the implementation of recommendations on strategies and the resulting operational measures within production.

The simulations are performed using the commercial FE package Abaqus/Explicit and validated using experimental results. The FE generated data consists of cutting speed, uncut chip thickness, and rake angle as the input parameters. The response variables are the cutting force and maximum tool temperature. The data is split into training and test sets using 80-20 split. The optimal SVR and GPR models are selected using grid search on the training data.

Given that pharmacovigilance itself operates in a high-noise, lower-validity environment without objective 'gold standards' beyond process definitions, the introduction of large volumes of SDM into the pharmacovigilance workflow has the potential to exacerbate issues with limited manual resources to perform adverse event identification and processing. Recent advances in medical informatics have resulted in methods for developing programs which can assist human experts in the detection of valid individual case safety reports (ICSRs) within SDM.        In this study, we developed rule-based and machine learning (ML) models for classifying ICSRs from SDM and compared their performance with that of human pharmacovigilance experts.        We used a random sampling from a collection of 311,189 SDM posts that mentioned Roche products and brands in combination with common medical and scientific terms sourced from Twitter, Tumblr, Facebook, and a spectrum of news media blogs to develop and evaluate three iterations of an automated ICSR classifier. The ICSR classifier models consisted of sub-components to annotate the relevant ICSR elements and a component to make the final decision on the validity of the ICSR. Agreement with human pharmacovigilance experts was chosen as the preferred performance metric and was evaluated by calculating the Gwet AC1 statistic (gKappa). The best performing model was tested against the Roche global pharmacovigilance expert using a blind dataset and put through a time test of the full 311,189-post dataset.        During this effort, the initial strict rule-based approach to ICSR classification resulted in a model with an accuracy of 65% and a gKappa of 46%. Adding an ML-based adverse event annotator improved the accuracy to 74% and gKappa to 60%. This was further improved by the addition of an additional ML ICSR detector. On a blind test set of 2500 posts, the final model demonstrated a gKappa of 78% and an accuracy of 83%. In the time test, it took the final model 48 h to complete a task that would have taken an estimated 44,000 h for human experts to perform.        The results of this study indicate that an effective and scalable solution to the challenge of ICSR detection in SDM includes a workflow using an automated ML classifier to identify likely ICSRs for further human SME review.",,10.1007/s40264-018-0641-7     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)     WE  - Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),ADVERSE DRUG-REACTIONS;PHARMACOVIGILANCE;SIGNALS,,,,,False,"The article focuses on machine learning for pharmacovigilance in social digital media, not on AI/ML use in SMEs for operational or competitive performance."

The aim of this study was to evaluate the post-antibiotic effects (PAE) and post-antibiotic sub-minimum inhibitory concentration (PA-SME) effects of carvacrol on Salmonella Typhimurium at different concentrations (1x, 2x, 4x MIC) and inoculum sizes (10(6) and 10(8) CFU/mL). The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of carvacrol was established at 0.6 mg/mL, with a required exposure time of 10 min for bacterial inhibition. The results demonstrated that carvacrol exhibited no PAE at the MIC. However, at the 2x MIC, the PAE was observed to be 2 h for the standard inoculum and 1 h for the high-density inoculum. At 4x MIC, the ECP exceeded 43.5 h for both inocula. Further exposure to sub-MIC carvacrol (0.15 mg/mL) after the post-antibiotic phase resulted in an extended ECP of over 43.5 h. These findings suggest that elevated carvacrol sub-MICs can markedly prolong PA-SME, potentially enabling reduced dosing frequencies, minimised adverse effects and enhanced efficacy in the treatment of infected animals and disinfection of agri-food facilities. Carvacrol is a compound present in essential oils with proven antimicrobial activity against numerous pathogens. We firstly determine the post-antibiotic effect (PAE) of carvacrol (1x, 2x, 4x MIC) and post-antibiotic sub-minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) effect (1x + 0.25x MIC and 2x + 0.25x MIC) for two concentrations of Salmonella Typhimurium ATCC14028 (10(6) and 10(8) CFU/mL). Prior to testing, the minimum concentration and exposure time to achieve the bacterial inhibition (MIC 0.6 mg/mL and 10 min) were determined by broth microdilution and time-kill curve methods, respectively. At the MIC, carvacrol did not generate any PAE. At twice the MIC, the PAE was 2 h with the standard inoculum (10(6) CFU/mL) and 1 h with the high-density inoculum (10(8) CFU/mL). At 4x MIC concentrations, the PAE was higher in both cases > 43.5 h. Continuous exposure of post-antibiotic phase bacteria (1x and 2x MIC) to carvacrol at 0.25x MIC (0.15 mg/mL) resulted in an increase in PAE (PA-SME) above 43.5 h with both inocula. These results suggest that the PA-SME of carvacrol for S. Typhimurium can be significantly prolonged by increasing the sub-MICs, which would allow dose spacing, reduce adverse effects and improve its efficacy in the treatment of infected animals and as a disinfectant in agri-food facilities.",,10.3390/ani14182631     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),minimum inhibitory concentration;post-antibiotic effect;post-antibiotic sub-minimum inhibitory concentration effect;bacterial growth suppression;natural antimicrobials;ESSENTIAL OILS;PATHOGENS;STRAINS,,,,,False,"The article focuses on the antimicrobial effects of carvacrol on bacteria, which is unrelated to the use of AI, ML, DL, ANN, or NN in SMEs' operations and their impact on organizational performance and competitiveness."

Industry 4.0 and IoT technologies facilitate the acquisition of ubiquitous data from machine tools and processes. However, these technologies also lead to the generation of a large number of data that are complex to be analyzed. Due to the streaming nature of the IoT systems, however, stream analytics could be used to extract features as the data are generated and published, which can prevent the need to store the data and perform advanced analytics that require high performance computing. This manuscript aims at demonstrating how traditional historical methods can be modified to be used as stream analytics tools for IoT data streams. Since data analytics is a wide domain, this paper has only focused on the two light-weighted methods that have been popular in the industry: Statistical Process Control Chart (SPCC), and Bayesian classification. This paper has defined, tested, and evaluated the accuracy and latency of the novel variation of these methods. It is concluded that by modifying the traditional methods and defining incremental solutions, methods such as Real -Time Dynamic Statistical Process Control Chart (RTDSPCC) and Incremental Gaussian Na ve Bayes (IGNB) can be formed that are highly beneficial for IoT applications as they are highly scalable, require minimal storage, and can update the models in real-time.

This paper examines data from the World Management Survey (WMS) using a new machine learning method termed as iterative random forest (iRF), which is used in the field of biostatistics. An empirical study of complementarity was conducted in small and medium-sized enterprises using WMS data. The effects of 18 management quality indicators on profitability, growth and viability were examined using machine learning methods (i.e. random forest [RF] and iRF). The analysis revealed the relative importance of whether high performers are properly rewarded, poor performers are reassigned and retrained and the criteria for high and low performance are well established. Furthermore, the study results revealed that the ability to set short-term goals based on a long-term perspective is complementary to many other indicators. These findings are consistent with the findings of a survey study that examined many empirical studies on the workings of institutional complementarity.

The purpose of this evaluation is to compare the performance of five unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms applied to a specific dataset from a small and medium-sized software enterprise, presented in this paper. To reduce the cost and complexity of a system developed to solve the problem of anomaly detection, a solution is to use machine learning (ML) algorithms that are available in one of the open-source libraries, such as the scikit-learn library or the PyOD library.

Analysis of the interconnectedness between assets and factors shows that their relationship is strong. The authors compare the allocation techniques, considering centrality and hierarchal-based networks. They demonstrate the advantages of graph theory to explain the advantages to portfolio management and the dynamic nature of assets and factors with their ""importance score."" They find that asset allocation can be efficiently derived using directed networks, dynamically driven by both US Treasuries and currency returns with significant centrality scores. Alternatively, the inverse variance weight estimation and correlation-based networks generate factor allocation with favorable risk-return parameters. Furthermore, factor allocation is driven mostly by the importance scores of the Fama-French-Carhart factors: SMB, HML, CMA, RMW, and MOM. The authors confirm previous results and argue that both factors and assets are interconnected with different value and momentum factors. Therefore, a blended strategy comprising factors and assets can be defensible for investors. As argued in previous research, factors are much more overcrowded than assets.

The type and amount of the SP component that suppresses sperm- polymorphonuclear neutrophil (PMN) binding in vitro was determined, and the effect of such suppression on the fertility of mares inseminated in the presence of uterine inflammation, was analyzed. Sperm cells were suspended in either SP, semen extender or a mixture of both, and each was mixed with PMN-rich uterine secretions collected at 12 h after artificial insemination (AI). SP reduced binding between spermatozoa and PMNs significantly (P < 0.05). Fertile spermatozoa were suspended in SP or semen extender and used to inseminate mares 12 h after the induction of uterine inflammation. The pregnancy rate was normal (77%) when spermatozoa were suspended in SP, but was dramatically reduced to only 5% when spermatozoa were suspended in extender.

Financial measures of profitability, leverage, coverage, liquidity, scale and non-financial information are explored, some commonalities and differences are highlighted. Several models are considered, starting with the logistic regression which is a standard approach in credit risk modelling. Some important improvements are investigated. Generalised Extreme Value (GEV) regression is applied in contrast to the logistic regression in order to produce more conservative estimates of default probability. The assumption of non-linearity is relaxed through application of BGEVA, non-parametric additive model based on the GEV link function. Two methods of handling missing values are compared: multiple imputation and Weights of Evidence (WOE) transformation. The results suggest that the best predictive performance is obtained by BGEVA, thus implying the necessity of taking into account the low volume of defaults and non-linear patterns when modelling SME performance. WoE for the majority of models considered show better prediction as compared to multiple imputation, suggesting that missing values could be informative.

However, configuring such machines requires technical experts, which are hard to find, especially for small and medium enterprises. Therefore, the process needs to be simplified by allowing non-experts to configure robots. During such configuration, one key aspect is the definition of objects' grasping poses. The literature proposes deep learning techniques to compute grasping poses automatically and facilitate the process. Nevertheless, practical implementation for inexperienced factory operators can be challenging, especially if task-specific knowledge and constraints should be considered. To overcome this barrier, we propose an approach that facilitates teaching such poses. Our method, employing a novel user grasp metric, combines the operator's initial grasp guess given by a 3D spatial device with a state-of-the-art deep learning algorithm, thus returning reliable grasping poses but simultaneously close to the operator's initial guess. We compare this approach against commercial grasping pose definition interfaces through a user test involving 28 participants and against state-of-the-art deep learning grasp estimators. The results demonstrate a significant improvement in system usability (+24%) and a reduced workload (-16%). Furthermore, our experiments reveal an increased grasp success rate when utilizing the user grasp metric, surpassing state-of-the-art deep learning grasping estimators. © 2024 The Authors.

A promising way to address this problem is by building a trustable, qualitative, interpretable models for the task based on SME knowledge. Such qualitative models can work as qualitative explainers of black-box models or as sanity checks for them. In this paper, qualitative models operate with ordinal attributes, which can be Boolean or k-valued attributes with a small k. Humans easier understand and reason with such attributes that with continuous numeric attributes with many more values. Some ML tasks do not have sufficient training data. Building qualitative models with a SME ('expert models') is a way to solve these tasks solely with a SME's knowledge. The proposed Monotone Ordinal Expert Knowledge Acquisition (MOEKA) system allows building 'expert models' through interview phases with the SME. Monotonicity is a key property of the system that is tested and used to shorten the interview process with a SME along with new methods for selecting the order of questions.

While the mobility sector is moving more toward EV’s, the electricity demand and volatility increase. Ideally, for those who can individualise parts of their electricity consumption, electricity should be consumed when there is low consumption and high production of renewable energy to reduce emissions and volatility. To optimise usage, a prediction of future energy consumption would be useful. Within the EFRE-financed research project ‘AI Factory SME’ the goal is to create a platform for dynamic electricity pricing based on predicting energy consumption and PV production from industry partners. This way, the natural fluctuations in the production of electricity from renewable energy sources are considered through a flexible payment model. Within this paper, the advantages of a renewables market place with dynamic pricing as a business model are described. Furthermore, a prediction of the energy consumption of an industry partner was realised using machine learning models in combination with weather and solar data as features.

In SME manufacturing facilities, people inspect products directly, what leads to oversights. Defective products are delivered to customers leading to causes and remedies for defects, apologies and compensation to customers Automatic detection of product defects in SMEs, especially in manufacturing, is a very important process and reduce costs as well as optimize corporate management. In the development of this technology, fault detection of LEDs on Display boards such as air conditioners and air purifiers was done by visual inspection in the past, but the image was obtained with a machine vision camera and the YOLOv5 algorithm was used to automatically detect defects. Adding a transformer to YOLOv5 make it is easy to understand the relationship between objects or the global context relating to the whole image, recognize complex patterns or structures, and reduce training time by using a framework that is well suited for parallel processing. Replacing the current module with a transformer in the YOLOv5 network helped developing an efficient algorithm, and the LED fault detection technology was tested in the production line. We propose an improved model with greater accuracy and speed than the existing YOLOv5 model.

The database search query was formulated as ""Bankruptcy Prediction"" and ""Model or Tool"". However, the authors intentionally did not specify any model or tool to make the search non-discriminatory. The authors reviewed over 7,300 articles.FindingsThis paper has addressed the research questions: (1) What are the most important publications of the core authors in terms of the target country, size of the sample, sector of the economy and specialization in SME? (2) What are the most used methods for deriving or adjusting models appearing in the articles of the core authors? (3) To what extent do the core authors include accounting-based variables, non-financial or macroeconomic indicators, in their prediction models? Despite the advantages of new-age methods, based on the information in the articles analyzed, it can be deduced that conventional methods will continue to be beneficial, mainly due to the higher degree of ease of use and the transferability of the derived model.Research limitations/implicationsThe authors identify several gaps in the literature which this research does not address but could be the focus of future research.Practical implicationsThe authors provide practitioners and academics with an extract from a wide range of studies, available in scientific databases, on bankruptcy prediction models or tools, resulting in a large number of records being reviewed. This research will interest shareholders, corporations, and financial institutions interested in models of financial distress prediction or bankruptcy prediction to help identify troubled firms in the early stages of distress.Social implicationsBankruptcy is a major concern for society in general, especially in today's economic environment. Therefore, being able to predict possible business failure at an early stage will give an organization time to address the issue and maybe avoid bankruptcy.Originality/valueTo the authors' knowledge, this is the first paper to identify the core authors in the bankruptcy prediction model and methods field. The primary value of the study is the current overview and analysis of the theoretical and practical development of knowledge in this field in the form of the construction of new models using classical or new-age methods.

In order to improve the efficiency of the subsequent SMB purification, the optimization of the fermentative broth composition in salts and sugars was investigated. Fermentations conducted at reduced amount of salts, using Aureobasidium pullulans whole cells, yielded 0.63 +/- 0.03 g of FOS per gram of initial sucrose. Additionally, a microbial treatment was proposed to reduce the amount of small saccharides in the mixture. Two approaches were evaluated, namely a co-culture of A. pullulans with Saccharomyces cerevisiae; and a two-step fermentation in which FOS were first synthesized byA. pullulans and then the small saccharides were metabolized by S. cerevisiae. Assays were performed in 100 mL shaken flasks and further scaled-up to a 3 L working volume bioreactor. Fermentations in two-step were found to be more efficient than the co-culture ones. FOS were obtained with a purity of 81.6 +/- 0.8% (w/w), on a dry weight basis, after the second-step fermentation with S. cerevisiae. The sucrose amount was reduced from 13.5 to 5.4% in total sugars, which suggests that FOS from this culture broth will be more efficiently separated by SMB. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

In Trial 1 crossbred yearling heifers (n = 208) were synchronized with Syncro-Mate-B (SMB) and artificially inseminated (AI) between 48 and 54 h following implant removal. Implant removal is defined as Day 1. Following AI, the heifers were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 experimental groups. Group 1 heifers were fed melengestrol acetate (MGA) daily from Day 17 to 21 at a rate of 0.5 mg/head, while Group 2 control received no exogenous progestin during this period. Synchrony of estrus was defined as the 3-d period in which the highest number of heifers expressed behavioral estrus in each group. There was no difference (P < 0.05) in the pregnancy rate during the second estrus due to MGA supplementation. More MGA-treated heifers (P < 0.01) expressed estrus in a 3-d period than the controls. In Trial 2, yearling heifers (n = 108) were synchronized with 2 injections of PGF(2a) (second PGF(2a) injection is designated as Day 1) administered 14 d apart with AI 12 h after the onset of behavioral estrus. The heifers were then randomly assigned to 1 of the following 3 treatment groups after initial AI: 1) MGA fed at 0.5 mg/head daily from Days 17 to 21; 2) norgestomet administered in 6.0-mg implants from Days 17 to 21; 3) untreated control heifers. Blood samples were collected on Day 21 and analyzed for progesterone (P-4) Elevated P-4 (> 1 ng/ml) on Day 21 indicated pregnancy to the first insemination. Synchrony among the 3 groups of heifers was similar (P > 0.10); however, the second estrus was less (P < 0.05) variable in the MGA and norgestomet treated heifers. During the resynchronized second estrus, conception rates were not affected by progestin treatment (MGA 40%, norgestomet 64%, and control 62%; P > 0.10).

However, SMEs in developing countries face numerous challenges to their sustainability, including limited resources and restricted access to technology. Information and Communication Technology (ICT) adoption has been identified as a critical strategy for enhancing the sustainability of SMEs. However, only a small percentage of SMEs have adopted ICT, which can improve productivity, efficiency, and competitiveness. This study aims to investigate the factors that influence the adoption of ICT and its impact on the sustainability of SMEs in Nigeria. A sample of 500 SMEs in Lagos state was surveyed using a quantitative methodology. Additionally, the technology, organization, and environment framework was used to examine the factors that influence the adoption of ICT and its impact on SMEs' sustainability. Furthermore, the study utilized a combination of structural equation modeling (SEM) and artificial neural network (ANN) analysis to examine the gathered survey data. The results of the SEM-ANN showed that technology, organization, and environment significantly impact adoption, and ICT adoption significantly influences SME sustainability. Additionally, the results further showed that the organizational factor is the most important for successful ICT adoption, followed by environmental and technological factors. The study concludes that SMEs in Lagos, Nigeria, should pay attention to ICTs relevant to their operations and consider their organization's characteristics and resources to adopt these technologies successfully. This research contributes to the existing literature on ICT adoption and SME sustainability in developing countries. It provides valuable insights for policymakers and SME owners in Nigeria and other developing countries. © 2023 IEEE.",,10.1109/SEB-SDG57117.2023.10124585,artificial neural network;ICT adoption;organization and environment framework;small and medium enterprises;structural equation modelling;technology;Developing countries;Sustainable development;Information and Communication Technologies;Information and communication technology adoption;Network-based approach;Nigeria;Organization and environment framework;Organizations and environments;Small-and-medium enterprise;Structural equation models;Technology;Technology adoption;Neural networks,,,,,True,"The article investigates the adoption of ICT, including artificial neural networks (ANN), by SMEs and its impact on sustainability, aligning with the research focus on AI and neural network technologies in SME operations and their influence on performance and competitiveness."

Multiclass classification, which involves more than two classes, is more complex than binary classification. There are mainly two ways to approach multiclass classification, one is to expand the binary classifier into a multiclass classifier through various strategies and the other is to divide the multiclass classification problem into multiple binary problems (binarization). Two popular approaches for binarization are One vs One (OvO) and One vs All (OvA). It is simpler to aggregate the outputs of all binary classifiers as the number of classifiers decreases. However, it causes an imbalance of positive and negative sample numbers, which affects the classification effect of each binary classifier. In this article, we contribute to the field of ensemble learning and multi-class classification by proposing a new method called Ensemble Partition Sampling (EPS). This article presents a new approach to multiclass classification using an ""Ensemble Partition Sampling"" method within the ""one-vs-all"" (OvA) framework. The primary goal of this method is to tackle the problem of data imbalance by incorporating ensemble learning and preprocessing techniques into each binary dataset. The study found that Ensemble Partition Sampling (EPS) is the most effective method for imbalanced and multiclass imbalanced classification, outperforming other methods including OvA, SMOTE, k-means-SMOTE, Bagging-RB, DES-MI, OvO-EASY, and OvO-SMB. The study used CART, Random Forest, and SVM as classifiers, and the results consistently showed that EPS outperformed all other algorithms. Based on the findings, it can be concluded that the EPS approach is a highly effective method for improving classification performance in imbalanced and multiclass imbalanced datasets.",,10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3273925     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Training data;Support vector machines;Ensemble learning;Deep learning;Random forests;Boosting;Learning systems;Ensemble partition sampling (EPS);one vs one (OvO);one vs all (OvA);multi-class classification;imbalanced learning;multiclass imbalanced classification;CHALLENGES;IMBALANCE,,,,,False,"The article focuses on multiclass classification techniques and ensemble learning methods without addressing AI adoption or impacts in SMEs, thus it does not align with the research topic on AI use in SME operations and organizational performance."

Intellectual capital (IC) features provide a meaningful alternative to analyse SMEs’ financial performance since companies with higher IC regularly achieve consistently higher sales growth. This paper aims to examine the possibilities of applying intellectual capital features in predicting SME bankruptcy. 14 IC features and 27 FR of 54,003 SMEs from 2016 to 2021 were collected from financial statements. Three groups of XGBoost and CatBoost models were developed–with only IC features, with only FR and combining FR and IC features. The results show that IC features are a practical addition to FR, with the best AUC equal to 89%, and their combination outperforms models using only FR by an average of 2.3%. Moreover, IC features such as capital employed efficiency and structural capital reduced the likelihood of SMEs’ bankruptcy. The implication of this study is that SME bankruptcy models perform better using IC features without significantly increasing financial cost or processing time, which can be helpful for financial institutions.

Unfortunately, deep packet inspection (DPI), a widely adopted method for PF, requires significant expert effort to develop and maintain protocol signatures. Additionally, the new solution paradigm, deep flow inspection (DFI) using machine learning for PF, also relies on hand-designed features. In this paper, we present ProNet, a payload based approach to protocol fingerprinting, which overcomes the limitation of artificial feature engineering. The key novelty of ProNet is two-fold: (i) it takes generic, raw short packet payloads as input, instead of the typical flow-statistical-features (e.g., port, packet size, packet-interval); (ii) it learns to simultaneously extract features via convolutional operations on the byte-level embeddings and ngram-level embeddings. We implement and evaluate ProNet on real-world traces, including DNS, QQLive, PPLive, PPStream, SopCast, DHCP, NBNS, HTTP, SMTP and SMB.

In addition, this study evaluated the intracellular mechanism(s) which contributes to the semicircadian rhythm in tuberoinfundibular dopaminergic neuronal activity during early pregnancy. The catalytic activity of TH in the SME was determined from the in vitro rate of 3,4,dihydroxyphenylalanine accumulation after inhibiting DOPA decarboxylase with brocresine. TH mRNA signal levels were evaluated by in situ hybridization. TH mRNA signal levels in the arcuate nuclei were 30% lower at 1000 h on day 20 of pregnancy as compared to days 7 and 11, whereas TH activity in the SME at 1000 h was not significantly different on days 7, 11, 16, and 20. Serum PRL levels were low (3-6 ng/ml) and unchanged at 1000 h on days 7, 11, 16, and 20. Circulating progesterone levels increased from 111 to 191 ng/ml on days 7 and 16, respectively, and then declined to 69 ng/ml by day 20. Serum estradiol levels increased from 38 to 106 pg/ml on day 7 and 16, respectively, and then remained elevated on day 20. Thus, the reduction in TH mRNA signal levels during late pregnancy is temporally related to the increased estradiol/progesterone ratio. Elevated serum PRL levels at 0330 h and 1800 h on day 7 were characteristic of the nocturnal and diurnal PRL surges of early pregnancy. Circulating PRL levels were low during the intersurge times (2330 and 1000 h) on day 7 and at all times examined on day 11. TH activity in the SME on day 7 was lower during the PRL surges as compared to the intersurge times, whereas TH activity on day 11 was similar at all times and comparable to the intersurge levels of early pregnancy. Okadaic acid, a protein phosphatase inhibitor, reversed the reduction in TH activity during the nocturnal and diurnal PRL surges, but did not significantly alter TH activity during the intersurge period on day 7. TH mRNA signal levels in the arcuate nuclei were similar throughout day 7. These data indicate that protein dephosphorylation, but not changes in the TH gene expression, may contribute to the semicircadian rhythm in TH activity during early pregnancy.

The model consist of worker capacity assessment and worker performance evaluation sub-models. The model measures the relationship between Total Mood Disturbance (TMD), heart rate of worker and workplace parameters using Kansei Engineering approach. However, the rapid measurement of TMD is difficult and full of bias since using the paper-based questionnaire of Profile of Mood States (POMS). Therefore, a rapid measurement method was developed using Artificial Neural Network to support the application of daily evaluation model. The inputs of the model were heart rate, workplace temperature, relative humidity, light intensity and noise level, which were measured before and after working. The output was TMD score. The training and inspection data for ANN was collected from workers of food production system as Tempe, Bakpia, Fish Chips and Crackers industries in Yogyakarta Special Region. ANN model were tested successfully predicted TMD score using back-propagation supervised learning method. The trained ANN model generated satisfied root mean square error value. ANN model is possible to substitute conventional data acquisition of POMS. The daily evaluation model is applicable to assist industrial management for providing the appropriate worker assignment for shift schedulling and environmental set point for the workplace comfortability.

In order to handle this waste effectively, the valorization of SCG is essential. SCG consists of beneficial phenolic compounds with antioxidative properties and caffeine, which can be recovered through extraction followed by separation and purification processes. In this work, water extraction of SCG was carried out. The volumetric composition of the liquid extract of SCG was then adjusted with an organic solvent, and the obtained mixture was used as the feed for subsequent separation. For the separation method of the SCG extract, a single chromatographic column was employed to separate a group of phenolic compounds (represented by chlorogenic acid) and a group of contaminants (represented by caffeine). The volumetric composition of the mobile phase was varied to determine the condition suitable for the separation of chlorogenic acid and caffeine in a C18 column. Adsorption parameters were determined and used to formulate the mathematical models describing the adsorption dynamics of those two bioactive compounds in the experimental breakthrough curves of standard solutions and the liquid extract of SCG. Furthermore, the three-zone simulated moving bed system (TZ-SMB) was designed to continuously separate fractions of chlorogenic acid and caffeine in the liquid extract of SCG. The adsorption parameters were employed in the optimization of TZ-SMB operating conditions using triangle theory, conducted via computer simulation. The experimental result of water extraction revealed that the yields of chlorogenic acid and caffeine were 0.292 and 0.583 mg/g dried SCG, respectively, using solid-to-liquid ratio of 1 g: 30 mL and temperature of 75 degrees C. The separation result in a single chromatographic column showed that the mobile phase consisting of acetonitrile, water, and formic acid (10: 90: 1.5 vol%) provided the linear adsorption isotherms for both chlorogenic acid and caffeine, and the chromatographic peaks of all compounds in the liquid extract of SCG were well separated.

Soil sample was mixed with 7 mL of acetone and 14 mL of wafer to allow partitioning of the PAHs from the soil to the liquid phase. A 12 muL octane drop suspended from a microsyringe needle tip was then immersed into the stirred solution-soil mixture for extraction. After an 11 min extraction, the octane drop was withdrawn into the syringe and injected directly into the GC for identification and quantification. The whole analysis procedure took 27 min, with an extraction time of 11 min, and a GC separation time of 16 min. A second extraction could be undertaken whilst the GC is running, hence the GC ran time currently limits the sample throughput. In this method, a small amount of organic solvent was used for the extraction process, which produced little waste.

Biological remediations of chromium are progressed by soil microbial fuel cell (SMFC) whose fuel performance is made remarkable in presence of carbonaceous biochar material. In the present study, various SMFCs were constructed individually using soil admixed with prepared biochars such as Echinochloa frumentacea (EFB), Zea mays (ZMB) and Solanum melongena (SMB) as fuel. The stainless steel electrodes of 3 x 3 x 0.2 cm geometric dimensions were employed as electrodes. Various desired concentrations such as 0.1 N, 0.125 N, 0.150 N, 0.175 N and 0.2 N of synthetically prepared Cr(VI) ions from potassium dichromate stock solutions were used as catholyte. The obtained potentials were measured using multimeter and the results were compared with control SMFC incorporated with distilled water as catholyte. The addition of three prepared biochars multiplied bacterial population to a tune of 5.2 x 106 CFU/mL in EFB, 3.8 x 106 CFU/mL in ZMB and 2.7 x 106 CFU/mL in SMB which was found to be 10 times more on comparison with bare soil population (0.3 x 105 CFU/mL). EFB added to SMFC (EFS), ZMB added to SMFC (ZMS) and SMB added to SMFC (SMS) operated well in the anodic pH window of 7.04 to 8.21 and complimented bacterial population with buffering capacity under toxic Cr(VI) environment (in the order of 106). The enhanced bacterial count favoured biofilm formation at the anode biotically for electrical power production. The lower Cr(VI) concentration cathode-loaded SMFCs such as 0.125 EFS, 0.125 ZMS and 0.1 SMS delivered a static maximum potential of 774 mV for 11 days, 755 mV for 16 days and 625 mV for 11 days respectively. 0.1 EFS delivered a static potential of 748 mV for 25 long days whose pH window varied in between 8.11 and 7.54 with stable bacterial count of 106 CFU/mL. The higher Cr(VI) concentration cathode-loaded SMFCs suppressed bacterial population to an order of 104 CFU/mL and decreased the anodic pH with electrical power. The anodic electrochemical assistance of biofilm with varying Cr(VI) concentration at the cathode was accessed using parameters such as charge transfer resistance and double layer capacitance as determined by Nyquist plot of AC impedance spectroscopy. The study concluded that lower values of anodic charge transfer resistance facilitated electron transport process. Increase in charge transfer resistance values was noticed with increase of chromium concentration and biofilm thickness which retards the electrical power generation. The morphologies of biofilm were investigated using SEM with EDS tool and the study evidenced the textural structure of biofilm with involvement of chromium ions in biofilm formation. In situ studies using CV and conventional methodologies showed the reduction of chromium at the cathode. The removal efficacy was found to be 16.49%.

Recently, deep learning based methods have achieved remarkable successes for singing melody extraction. However, most of the existing models are based on stacked convolution layers to progressively obtain task-specific features. Such an architecture has two limitations: 1) in the training stage, when the global semantic feature is obtained, the global semantic feature will be directly used to make predictions. There is a lack of a process that makes SME models learn knowledge from training errors in an in-depth way. 2) there exist semantic gaps between features from different levels in the prior SME models. The inconsistent features from different levels may cause suboptimal performances. To address the above mentioned problem, in this paper, we propose a review network (RevNet) with group aggregation fusion for singing melody extraction. Specifically, the proposed network is based on an encoder-decoder network, which consists of two modules: review module and group aggregation fusion (GAF) module. The review module aims to make the model be able to learn training errors interactively. We design multiple review modules to iterately review the training errors. The design of this module is like a review process to force the model to learn knowledge from prior prediction errors. The GAF module aims to fuse the features from different levels and makes multi-level features complementary. A set of dilated convolution operations are performed on our designed grouped high-level and low-level features.

Despite the potential for gaining deeper insights in operational performance and improving efficiency, many small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) struggle to capitalize on data-driven insights, largely due to poor data analytics (DA) skills and scarcely documented use-cases. Despite initial efforts, i.a. in a learning factory (LF) context, the transition to advanced analytics, particularly machine learning techniques, is often hampered by a lack of hands-on learning offerings. Exploring the role that LFs can play in bridging this gap, this study illustrates potential benefits of merging process and machine data from LFs with different production settings. After selecting SME-specific use-cases through literature research and interviews with SMEs in the region, data management (DM) requirements to support teaching activities of advanced DA for SMEs in a scenario-based learning setting were assessed and relevant data from the LFs were identified. On this basis, a DM concept for our LFs to support teaching with data from different production systems was developed. We could show that our DM approach covers a wide range of SME-relevant DA tasks.

However, it is difficult to guarantee that all cutting anomalies can be detected during mass production due to various events that can occur. Moreover, machine learning and pattern recognition are not systemized for use in mass production. In this work, we investigated the detection of turning anomalies during mass production under optimized cutting conditions. We applied a method that utilizes the motor current of each operating axis to monitor the machining state without affecting the machining process and determines the correlation between turning anomalies and motor data. Our target was the unsteady anomalies that appear in mass production, such as chip biting and tool vibration. On the basis of the obtained correlation, we developed a formalized anomaly detection method using traditional statistics and a systemized anomaly detection method using discretization and pattern recognition based on the Mahalanobis Taguchi method with auto parameter tuning to eliminate the need for detailed analysis based on knowledge of cutting phenomena. Both methods achieved a detection accuracy of over 98%. (c) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Diestrous or ovariectomized rats were injected with BROMO (3 mg/kg, s.c.) at 1000 h and were sacrificed 4 h later or were injected with BROMO at 12 h intervals for 3 days. In vitro tyrosine hydroxylase activity was assessed by incubating hypothalamic explants with brocresine, an L-aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor, and measuring 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) accumulation in the stalk-median eminence (SME). The incubation medium also contained either 2 Cure okadaic acid, a protein phosphatase 1 and 2A inhibitor, or its vehicle (0.25% dimethylsulfoxide). Acute (4 h) and chronic (3 days) BROMO treatment suppressed circulating PRL levels from 10-12 ng/ml to < 1 ng/ml and reduced tyrosine hydroxylase activity in the SME by 60% or 40% in diestrous or ovariectomized rats, respectively. Okadaic acid increased tyrosine hydroxylase activity in the SME 2-fold in control diestrous or ovariectomized rats. The reduced tyrosine hydroxylase activity in the SME after acute BROMO treatment was increased by okadaic acid 5- or 3-fold in diestrous or ovariectomized rats respectively, to a value similar to the controls. In sharp contrast, after chronic BROMO treatment, the response to okadaic acid was blunted. As assessed by in situ hybridization, tyrosine hydroxylase mRNA signal levels in the arcuate nucleus of diestrous rats were not altered after acute BROMO treatment, but were reduced by 70% after chronic BROMO treatment The acute BROMO-induced decrease in tyrosine hydroxylase activity was reversed by co-administration of oPRL or rPRL, indicating that the action of BROMO is via a reduction in PRL, The data suggest that protein dephosphorylation may be a primary mechanism for the rapid BROMO-dependent suppression of tyrosine hydroxylase activity, whereas suppression of tyrosine hydroxylase gene expression may contribute to the lower tyrosine hydroxylase activity after chronic BROMO treatment.

DGF is an innovative guarantee financing program that contributes to mitigating the risk-return imbalance for guarantors. We develop Stackelberg game models and derive equilibrium decisions for each financing scheme separately under the two wholesale pricing scenarios: exogenous and endogenous. Our research indicates when the wholesale price is predetermined exogenously, either of the two financing schemes can be preferred by all supply chain parties, depending on the wholesale price, the production cost, and the profit dividend ratio. However, under the endogenous wholesale pricing scenario, both the retailer and the entire supply chain consistently prefer DGF over DF, whereas the supplier only benefits from DGF when the production cost is comparatively high. We further identify conditions under which both the supplier and the retailer exhibit alignment in their preferences, finding that both DF and DGF can create a win-win situation (i.e., preference alignment) for both parties under an exogenous wholesale pricing scenario. Nevertheless, only DGF can ensure a mutually beneficial outcome under an endogenous wholesale pricing scenario. Interestingly, we demonstrate that DGF retains a beneficial tolerance effect toward high production costs and high wholesale prices. Such a distinctive financing advantage of DGF can foster a triple-win situation for the retailer, supplier, and the entire supply chain. Managerial Relevance Statement-Large firms increasingly rely on SME suppliers for product sourcing, but these suppliers often face financial constraints and struggle to secure bank loans due to poor credit history. Insufficient financial support may cause underinvestment, supply delays, or even disruptions. As such, this paper investigates the relative efficacy of two buyer-initiated financing schemes, namely DF and DGF, in addressing the financial constraints of suppliers. We aim to study: (1) supply chain parities' financing preference between DF and DGF; and (2) the financing value of the innovative DGF program. Findings provide significant managerial insights. First, suppliers in low-production cost industries, such as retail or agricultural, should embrace DF. Conversely, suppliers facing high production cost investments, like automotive manufacturing or semiconductors, should actively lobby retailers to provide DGF. Second, large retailers should maintain an open attitude toward providing DGF, particularly when they possess wholesale pricing power. Third, compared to traditional GF, this innovative DGF program exhibits distinctive advantages in mitigating the risk-return imbalance of guarantors and enhancing supply chain efficiency. Meanwhile, carefully designing the profit dividend ratio is crucial, as an appropriate ratio not only aligns supply chain members' preferences but supports the long-term stability of the supply chain relationship.",,10.1109/TEM.2025.3575350     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)     WE  - Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Supply chains;Production;Pricing;Costs;Training;Investment;Data mining;Business;Artificial intelligence;Sustainable development;Direct financing;dividend-for-guarantee swap financing;financial constraints;Stackelberg game;supply chain management;TRADE CREDIT;VS.

Whereas rapid bactericidal activity is the hallmark in vitro and in vivo response to CF-301 at exposures higher than the MIC, prolonged antimicrobial activity, mediated by cell wall damage, is predicted at concentrations less than the MIC. In the current study, a series of in vitro pharmacodynamic parameters, including the postantibiotic effect (PAE), postantibiotic sub-MIC effect (PA-SME), and sub-MIC effect (SME), were studied to determine how short-duration and sub-MIC CF-301 exposures affect the growth of surviving staphylococci and extend its antimicrobial activity. Mean PAE, PA-SME, and SME values up to 4.8, 9.3, and 9.8 h, respectively, were observed against 14 staphylococcal strains tested in human serum; growth delays were extended by 6 h in the presence of daptomycin. Exposures to CF-301 at sub-MIC levels as low as 0.001x to 0.01x MIC (similar to 1 to 10 ng/ml) resulted in aberrant cell wall ultrastructure, increased membrane permeability, dissipation of membrane potential, and inhibition of virulence phenotypes, including agglutination and biofilm formation. A mouse thigh infection model designed to study the PAE was used to confirm our findings and demonstrate in vivo growth delays of >= 19.3 h.

However, finding a suitable hyperparameters configuration is difficult, challenging, and computationally expensive due to three issues, which are 1) the mixed-variable problem of different types of hyperparameters; 2) the large-scale search space of finding optimal hyperparameters; and 3) the expensive computational cost for evaluating candidate hyperparameters configuration. Therefore, this article focuses on these three issues and proposes a novel estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) for efficient hyperparameters optimization, with three major contributions in the algorithm design. First, a hybrid-model EDA is proposed to efficiently deal with the mixed-variable difficulty. The proposed algorithm uses a mixed-variable encoding scheme to encode the mixed-variable hyperparameters and adopts an adaptive hybrid-model learning (AHL) strategy to efficiently optimize the mixed-variables. Second, an orthogonal initialization (OI) strategy is proposed to efficiently deal with the challenge of large-scale search space. Third, a surrogate-assisted multi-level evaluation (SME) method is proposed to reduce the expensive computational cost. Based on the above, the proposed algorithm is named surrogate-assisted hybrid-model EDA (SHEDA). For experimental studies, the proposed SHEDA is verified on widely used classification benchmark problems, and is compared with various state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, a case study on aortic dissection (AD) diagnosis is carried out to evaluate its performance.

Therefore, this study investigated the effects of alkaline and acidic electrolyzed water (AIEW and AEW, mg/mL) as alternative pretreatments to SMB (1% w/w) for 'Tommy Atkins' mango slices prior to hot air drying at 60 degrees C. Fresh-cut and untreated samples were used as a control.

Colour parameters (L*, a*, and b*) were measured, and use to determine colour intensity (C*), hue angle (h degrees), and total colour difference (TCD) before and after drying. Based on measured weight, continuous decline in MR was recorded for all dried mango slices over the drying time irrespective on treatment.

However, the practical application of these methods encounters a conundrum involving accuracy and interpretability. In this study, a multi-stage ensemble model is proposed to enhance the model's interpretability. To strengthen predictive portraits, a multi-feature enhancement method is proposed to integrate non-financial behavioral information and soft information on credit rating into the annual loan ledger data, thereby bolstering the explanatory capacity of the features. To rectify the issue of data imbalance and avoid information loss, a new bagging-based oversampling method is proposed to oversample the minority class samples in multiple parallelized subsets divided by the bagging strategy. To unleash the performance potential of base classifiers, a new voting-weight optimization method is proposed to optimize the soft voting weights of the candidate base classifiers. The experiment results of an annual loan ledger dataset of a commercial bank in China (with an accuracy of 97.9%, an area under the curve of 0.97, a logistic loss of 0.07, a Brier score of 0.01, and a Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic of 0.38) and the other five public datasets indicating excellent model fit. By focusing on the widespread soft information and data structures characteristic of SME loan risk assessment data, an additional SHAP model explanation method enhances interpretability.

As a result, it is necessary to investigate the metabolic components that affect seed physiology and germination. Therefore, in the present study, seed metabolic efficiency (SME) and various biochemical parameters were observed, such as total soluble sugars, total starch, total soluble protein, total free amino acids, and alpha-amylase content. It was observed that seeds primed with 500 mu gml-1 KNO 3 for 12 h and 24 h respectively, recorded maximum seed metabolic efficiency. Priming in GA 3 and KNO 3 showed significant improvement in the biochemical parameters which was manifested in better seed metabolic efficiency. Further, correlation analysis validated that SME exhibited a significant positive correlation with the content of total soluble sugar, total free amino acids, and alpha- amylase activity and negatively correlated with total starch and total soluble protein content.

Accordingly, the tablet defect identified before bottling is a crucial issue in the pharmaceutical industry. Presently, the defect checking usually relies on either manual sampling, visual image processing or combination of deep learning methods in the manufactory. Nevertheless, currently it still lacks both simple and effective mechanism to tackle this problem in industry. For this reason, the tablet defect detection model is developed using a biaxial planes discrete scanning algorithm based on simple algebraic calculation. Therefore, actual tablet shape can be quickly identified, and the defect status can be thus evaluated accurately. Initially, the standard tablet shape is formed using biaxial planes discrete scanning process from both front and side views, respectively. Second, analog output signal generated from the image sensor is transformed into a series digital code in an array. Third, every tablet for investigation is processed following up the same steps as the standard tablet does. Finally, the defect status is determined using similarity gap and square mean error (SME) between the standard tablet and detected one. The experimental results reveal that the defect tablet has a significantly big similarity gap over the standard one up to 20% and 100% in front and side views, respectively. On the other hand, the square mean error (SME) reaches 7903 and 5393 in front and side views, respectively.

By analyzing and defining the composition, properties, and characteristics of raw materials, predictive models can optimize system performance and decision-making processes. In the context of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) like SCODER, limited resources constrain data collection for decision-making due to factors such as limited data availability, smaller production volumes, and less advanced traceability, leading to variability in data quality and structure. This research explores the impact of material characteristics on industrial part conformity with scarce and sparse data. Material impurities significantly affect the quality and stability of industrial machined parts. Some machine learning and AI techniques address the complexity of analyzing material datasets to identify patterns that lead to deficiencies in machined parts. We propose a smart long short-term memory (LSTM) model for predicting part conformity in industrial machined parts. This work focuses on analyzing raw material data to study machining stability and understand the dependencies between material data and part quality holistically.

In an advanced application it is to be coupled to a continuous chromatographic separation process which uses a simulated moving bed (SMB) (Ishikawa et al., US4182633, 19/12/1977). This combination is expected to make continuous flow syntheses economical even with lower yield reactions, simultaneously leading to purified products. For this application, a divided electrochemical micro cell reactor was designed, fabricated and tested. Per electrode plane it uses an electrode area of 114 cm(2) carrying 75 parallel micro channels with a channel-length of 189 mm on electrodes sized 189 x 98 mm(2). The reactor design allows the use of either divided or combined cells operated in bipolar or monopolar mode. The design consists of layered independent cell-modules and is therefore highly extendible and versatile in the choice of electrode materials. To implement the reactor in the reactor/SMB-purification system, the new design requires a pressure tightness at about 30 bar at flow rates of some 10 ml min(-1) and no limitations regarding the solvents.

Methods and results SMBs and EMBs were morphometrically and morphologically analysed in 30 consecutive patients aged 40.7 +/- 14 years (16-63), including 25 in NYHA classes I and II. Four had familial DCM. Serum creatine-phosphokinase (sCPK) was normal in 23 and slightly increased in seven.        All the SMBs showed morphological (including non-recurrent changes different from those in the EMBs) and morphometric changes, with atrophic fibres in all cases (atrophy factor > 150 in six NYHA II patients) and necrotic fibres in three. The SMBs of two patients with EMB-proven myocarditis showed inflammation. Plotting the morphometric factors against age at symptom onset, age at diagnosis, follow-up, clinical outcome, ejection fraction and sCPK levels showed that only sCPK > 180 mU/ml correlated with atrophy factor.        Conclusions The use of SMB in DCM patients documents some aspecific subclinical muscle damage that is unrelated to the functional class and duration of the DCM. However, this information does not contribute to identify the aetiology or managing the disease. (C) 2004 The European Society of Cardiology. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The drive towards continuous processing offers one opportunity to address these costs through the advantages it offers. Continuous operation presents opportunities for real-time process monitoring and automated control with potential benefits including predictable product specification, reduced labour costs, and integration with other continuous processes. Specifically to chromatographic operations continuous processing presents an opportunity to use expensive media more efficiently while reducing their size and therefore cost. Here for the first time we show how a new adsorbent material (cellulosic nanofibers) having advantageous convective mass transfer properties can be combined with a high frequency simulated moving bed (SMB) design to provide superior productivity in a simple bioseparation. Electrospun polymeric nanofiber adsorbents offer an alternative ligand support surface for bioseparations. Their non-woven fiber structure with diameters in the sub-micron range creates a remarkably high surface area material that allows for rapid convective flow operations. A proof of concept study demonstrated the performance of an anion exchange nanofiber adsorbent based on criteria including flow and mass transfer properties, binding capacity, reproducibility and life-cycle performance. Binding capacities of the DEAE adsorbents were demonstrated to be 10 mg/mL, this is indeed only a fraction of what is achievable from porous bead resins but in combination with a very high flowrate, the productivity of the nanofiber system is shown to be significant. Suitable packing into a flow distribution device has allowed for reproducible bind-elute operations at flowrates of 2,400 cm/h, many times greater than those used in typical beaded systems. These characteristics make them ideal candidates for operation in continuous chromatography systems. A SMB system was developed and optimised to demonstrate the productivity of nanofiber adsorbents through rapid bind-elute cycle times of 7s which resulted in a 15-fold increase in productivity compared with packed bed resins. Reproducible performance of BSA purification was demonstrated using a 2-component protein solution of BSA and cytochrome c. The SMB system exploits the advantageous convective mass transfer properties of nanofiber adsorbents to provide productivities much greater than those achievable with conventional chromatography media.

We studied the effect of DS on platelet and leucocyte function and compared the effects with conventional antiplatelet agents, cangrelor (ADP P2Y(12) receptor antagonist) and aspirin (acetyl salicylic acid, ASA). Measurements were made by platelet aggregation (%) and activation (CD62P %), platelet-monocyte conjugate formation (P/M, CD42a median fluorescence, mf), platelet-neutrophil conjugate formation (P/N, mf), and leucocyte activation (CD11b median fluorescence on monocytes and neutrophils, mf) in response to 3.3 mu mol/L adenosine diphosphate (ADP), 1.0 mu mol/L platelet activating factor (PAF), 5.0 mu mol/L adrenaline and 0.5 mu g/mL collagen.

The aim of the paper was to compare the food qualities of 2 varieties (SME 1 and 2) of high quality cassava flour (HQCF) produced from indigenous technology and that of some commercially sold wheat/HQCF samples.        Material and methods. The pH, proximate, phytochemical, antioxidant, functional properties and starch yield of the flours were carried out using standard techniques.        Results. The wheat flours had higher bulk densities and lipids than the HQCF samples while the oil absorption capacity of the HQCF (SME 2) was higher than other flour samples investigated. The antioxidant assays of the flours showed that they contained considerable levels of antioxidants with the HQCF sample from DAT having higher antioxidants than other flour samples studied. The HQCF (SME 1) had significantly higher (P < 0.05) starch content among the flour samples. The bacteria counts of the HQCF samples ranged from 0 to 1.4 x 10(4) cfu/ml while the fungal count ranged from 0 to 2 x 10(-3) with the unbranded wheat flour having the highest microbial load compared with other flour samples studied.        Conclusion. The use of this indigenous technology produces HQCF with lower lipids, microbial contamination but higher flavour retaining ability, flavonoids and starch contents than wheat flour. The significant positive correlation (R-2 = 0.872) between reducing power of the samples and their DPPH antioxidant activity indicate that either could be used to assay for the total antioxidant activity of cassava and wheat flour.

Objective:This study screens and explores naturally occurring bioactive constituents from the root of SMB acting on renin activity and evaluates its osteoprotective efficacy in diabetic mice. Materials and methods:Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells, engineered to express human renin, were used as anin vitromodel to identify bioactive compound, tanshinone IIA, inhibiting renin activity. The C57BL/6 mice (n = 10 in each group) with diabetes induced by streptozotocin (STZ) were intraperitoneally injected with tanshinone IIA (10 and 30 mg/kg). The mice without STZ treatment and the diabetic mice treated with aliskiren were used as non-diabetic control and positive control, respectively. Results:Tanshinone IIA was found to display inhibitory effects on renin activity of HEK-293 cells; moreover, it down-regulated protein expression of ANG II in human renin-expressed HEK-293 cells.

Electron ionization of vibrationally cold molecules in the supersonic molecular beams (SMB) (cold EI) provided mass spectra with enhanced molecular ion, yet with good library search results and superior identification probabilities. We found that high GC column flow rates lower the elution temperature for any given compounds. This allows much larger molecules to elute at the maximum temperature of standard columns. We analyzed a mixture of heavy linear chain hydrocarbons all the way to C84H170 with a molecular weight of 1179.3 amu, using a 4 m 0.25 mm i.d. column and 32 ml/min He flow rate. Furthermore, we obtained a dominant molecular ion to all these compounds. The lower elution temperatures also greatly enhance the ability to analyze very thermally labile compounds such as carbamate pesticides. The experimental 1200 system is capable of triple quadrupole based MS-MS. We found that MS-MS on the molecular ion is much more effective than on fragment ions, and thus, the enhancement of the molecular ion directly improves the MS-MS sensitivity. Fast GC-MS analysis was also explored, based on very high column flow rate for fast splitless injections without affecting the sensitivity, and on the high system selectivity due to the combination of enhanced molecular ion and MS-MS. We demonstrate a few seconds long GC-MS-MS analysis of diazinon, spiked at 10 ng/g in a mixed fruit and vegetable extract. The feature of enhanced molecular ion provides significant enhancement in the detection sensitivity via SIM and RSIM on the molecular ion. While octafluoronaphthalene (OFN) detection limit of below 1 fg in SIM mode is shown, the harder is the compound analysis by standard GC-MS the greater is the gain in sensitivity by 1200-SMB. For example, the use of the 1200-SMB resulted in an improvement of over 50 times in the RSIM detection limit of cholesterol on its molecular ion at m/z = 386, and decabromobiphenylether could be analyzed in SIM mode at 1 ppb with S/N > 50 (peak-to-peak noise).

Agile manufacturers typically run small scale operations (20 people or less), make short runs of many products and are continuously involved in their design - both at detailed and conceptual levels. This can be a strength in terms of international competitiveness where knowledge of the production process, the product end user needs, and the machinery and tooling itself combine to produce innovation. SME manufacturers are actually designers. Their employees think about design as they manufacture. We foresee that the Operator may transition to a Maker - a person who works alongside the automated production system but with a different role - one which is essentially creative, rather than assisting or monitoring non-discretionary work flow steps or processes.",,10.1016/j.cie.2018.10.047     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)     WE  - Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Automation;Industrie 4.0;Smart factories;Advanced manufacturing;Work organisation;Safety;AGENDA;FUTURE,,,,,False,"The abstract focuses on human-automation symbiosis and creative roles in SME manufacturing rather than the use of AI, ML, DL, or neural networks in SME operations, which is outside the research scope."

The poor data quality of DoD maintenance data is a critical issue, experienced by a wide range of organizations, that leads to poor predictive modeling, lack of transparency in performed maintenance, and adverse downstream effects due to incorrect reporting.        The most common example of poor data quality in DoD data is in coded fields, such as WUC. Maintainers have a variety of codes that can be entered in these fields, with the expectation that the code entered corresponds to the maintenance action performed. When poor data quality is noticed by stakeholders, large teams of SMEs are brought in to read the text description provided by maintainers to update the coded fields. It is generally assumed in DoD maintenance applications that the text provided in the MAF is a highly accurate representation of the maintenance event. Thus, there is an opportunity to use Natural Language Processing (NLP) to automate the process of updating coded fields using the text fields directly.        We address the current data quality issues by proposing a three-pronged approach based on NLP to automate the discovery of mislabeled codes in DoD MAFs using the MAF text fields directly. Our approach leverages domain expertise from subject matter experts (SME), semi-supervised learning (SSL) to use small amounts of labeled data from SMEs, and an ensemble approach; each of which identifies potentially mislabeled MAFs. This approach allows for the integration of domain expertise and machine learning to update incorrectly coded fields.        We demonstrate our automated data cleansing approach through a case study of the LAU-127 Launcher, which has 67k MAFs from July 2010 - July 2020. For our case study, we specifically examine the WUC field, but our method can be applied to other coded fields in MAFs. By applying our method to a collection of MAFs to update the WUC, we identify 10k mislabeled MAFs using our rule-based approach, 14k mislabeled MAFs using SSL, and 5k MAFs using our ensemble method. Altogether, our approach identified 29k MAFs with mislabeled WUC. This result is within the range of expected mislabeled incorrect MAFs, 28k-35k MAFs, provided by the dataset maintainer and SME (D.M.S.). Further, a subset of our WUC corrections were validated by a maintainer and identified to be 87% accurate.

Several approaches have also been undertaken to improve the refolding yield of these systems, mostly under batch operation. Although, these approaches may lead to an increase on refolding yield, it is not expected that they will lead to significant increases in other important process indicators, such as volumetric productivity, specific eluent consumption and product concentration in the product stream; as these indicators are strongly dependent on the mode of operation. To overcome the shortcomings of batch chromatography, the size-exclusion refolding reactor may be operated in a continuous mode, with the aid of Simulated Moving Bed (SMB) technology. Albeit, SMB technology has inherent advantages over batch chromatography, these have been proven mainly in the context of conventional purifications and are still to be addressed in the context of chromatographic refolding reactors. In this work we report the on-column refolding of an industrially relevant protein, produced in inclusion bodies, by batch size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) and simulated moving bed size-exclusion chromatography (SMBSEC). The presented study encompasses: (1) a statistical design of experiments (DOE) to study the combined effect of the mobile phase pH (9.011.20) and the feed concentration of denatured and reduced protein (C-f,C-D&R=2.507.50 mg ml(-1)) on the refolding yield of the model protein; (2) a mechanistic analysis of the SMBSECR data, using a detailed model that accounts for both separation and refolding; and (3) a detailed comparison of the SMBSECR against the SECR, based both on quantitative and qualitative criteria. Our work showed that: (1) refolding yields of 50% are attainable by tuning pH and C-f,C-D&R, and that the positive effect of pH is strongly dependent on the C-f,C-D & R; (2) the modeling tool captured well the SMBSECR behavior, based solely on the effect that C-f,C-D&R has on the reaction rates; and (3) the volumetric productivity of the SMBSECR is about 53 times higher than that of the SECR, the specific solvent consumption is approximately 1/10th of that of the SECR, and the concentration of the product (i.e., native protein), leaving the SMBSECR, is roughly 4.5-fold higher than the one leaving the SECR.

The aim of the study was to investigate the antiRANK signal effect of the combination of S. miltiorrhiza Bunge (SME) and liquefied calcium (LCa) supplement with ovariectomized (OVX-SML) mice, a osteoporosis animal model. Results were compared to 17 beta-estradiol (E-2) treatment.        Methods: A total of 70 female ICR strain mice (7 weeks) were randomly divided into 10 groups with 7 mice in each group as follows: (1) sham-operated control mice (sham) received daily oral phosphate-buffered-saline (PBS) of equal volumes through oral administration. (2) OVX mice received a daily oral administration of PBS (OVX). (3) OVX mice treated daily with 50 mg/kg b.w./day of SME (4) with 100 mg/kg b.w./day of SME or (5) with 200 mg/kg b.w./day of SME via oral administration. (6) OVX mice treated daily with 50 mg/kg b.w./day of SML (7) with 100 mg/kg b.w./day of SML or (8) with 200 mg/kg b.w./day of SML via oral administration. (9) OVX mice treated daily with 10 ml/kg b.w./day of LCa (10) OVX mice received i.p. injections of 17 beta-estradiol (E-2) (0.1 mg/kg b.w./day) three times per week for 12 weeks.        Results: micro-CT analysis revealed that oral administration of SML inhibited tibial bone loss, sustained trabecular bone state, and ameliorated bone biochemical markers. In addition, SML administration compared to SEM and LCa reduced serum levels of RANKL, osteocalcin and BALP through increased serum levels of OPG and E2 in OVX mice. SML also had more beneficial effects on protection of estrogen-dependent bone loss through blocking expression of TRAF6 and NFTAc1 and produces cathepsin K and calcitonin receptor to develop osteoclast differentiation.

As a result of customization, the variety of products handled by a warehouse has increased, making storage location assignment problems more complicated. Different approaches have been proposed by researchers for improving storage assignment and order picking. However, many industrial practitioners find it difficult to adopt such approaches due to complexity and high associated costs. In particular, small and medium enterprises (SMEs), that generally, lack resources and who have staff members with weak artificial intelligence backgrounds, still rely on experience when assigning storage locations for diverse products. In these circumstances, the quality of decision making cannot be guaranteed. In view of this, an intelligent system which can be easily adopted by SMEs is designed to improve storage location assignment problems. The proposed system, an RFID-based storage assignment system (RFID-SAS), is a rule-based system incorporating radio frequency identification (RFID) provides decision support for storage assignment in a warehouse. Unlike many existing situations, RFID tags are attached to products at the item level instead of at the pallet level. As the knowledge embedded in the system is represented in the form of rules, evaluation is important and is outlined in this paper.

Inspired by their success, these models are now used in health care for tasks such as clinical documentation and medical record classification. However, language models are prone to errors, which can have serious consequences in critical domains such as health care, ensuring that their reliability is essential to maintain patient safety and data integrity. METHODS To address this, we propose an innovative auditing process based on principles from clinical trial design. Our approach involves subject matter experts (SMEs) manually reviewing pathology reports without previous knowledge of the model's classification. This single-blind setup minimizes bias and allows us to apply statistical rigor to assess model performance. RESULTS Deployed at the British Columbia Cancer Registry, our audit process effectively identified the core issues in the operational models. Early interventions addressed these issues, maintaining data integrity and patient care standards. CONCLUSION The audit provides real-world performance metrics and underscores the importance of human-in-the-loop machine learning. Even advanced models require SME oversight to ensure accuracy and reliability.

Similarly, MICs of doripenem for both AmpC-inducible and -derepressed Enterobacter isolates were 0.06 to 0.5 mug/ml. ESBL production did not raise the MICs of doripenem for Escherichia coli transconjugants, and studies with known expression mutants confirmed that neither inducible nor depressed AmpC beta-lactamase expression was protective in Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, Serratia marcescens, or Morganella morganii. In all of these respects, doripenem resembled meropenem and imipenem, whereas the MICs of ertapenem were raised (but still less than or equal to1 mug/ml) for many ESBL-producing klebsiellas and AmpC-derepressed E. cloacae and C. freundii strains. Resistance to all carbapenems, including doripenem (MICs of mostly 16 to 64 mug/ml, compared with 0.25 to 1 mug/ml for typical strains), was seen in Acinetobacter isolates with metallo-beta-lactamases or OXA-carbapenemases. Isolates of Klebsiella and Serratia spp. with IMP, KPC, and SME beta-lactamases also were resistant to doripenem (MICs, 8 to >64 mug/ml) and to other carbapenems, although the continued apparent susceptibility (MICs, less than or equal to0.5 mug/ml) of E. coli derivatives with cloned IMP-1 and NMC-A beta-lactamases suggested that carbapenem resistance might require other factors besides the enzymes.",,10.1128/AAC.48.4.1313-1319.2004     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),VIVO ANTIBACTERIAL ACTIVITIES;INTENSIVE-CARE UNITS;IN-VITRO;ANTIBIOTIC-RESISTANCE;CARBAPENEM RESISTANCE;KLEBSIELLA;BAUMANNII;S-4661;ERTAPENEM;MK-0826,,,,,False,"The article focuses on antibiotic testing against bacterial isolates and does not address AI, ML, DL, ANN, or their use in SMEs' operations or organizational performance."

This paper examines multistage 'manufacturing processes, where system complexity can greatly influence the burden of creating custom tailored monitoring solutions. Such barriers have encouraged many manufacturing small and medium enterprises (SME) to look towards generic 'black box' commercial software solutions, although they may lack the sufficient expertise to objectively determine which product best meets their requirements. Some of the considerations faced by SMEs are identifying tools that can successfully be deployed alongside a potential lack of sensor coverage and/or the desire for rapid system reconfiguration to accommodate smaller custom batch production sizes.

Furthermore, machine learning has been applied to predict tool life as a function of cutting speed. However, the existing research does not consider the discrete-event dynamics in machine shop, i.e., the machine tool needs to process a series of parts in queue under various practical production requirements. This paper addresses the integration of discrete-event dynamics and machining dynamics to achieve cost savings in machining. A learning-based cost function is first proposed for the studied integrated optimization problem of machine tool. The proposed cost function utilizes the predicted tool life under different stable cutting speeds for further optimizing speed selection of machine tool to deal with the discrete-event dynamics in machine shop. Then, according to the practical production requirements, effective mathematical optimization models are developed for the related integrated optimization problems with the consideration of cost, makespan and due date, respectively.

The aim of this study was to evaluate whether various extract solutions of Sapindus mukorossi have dissolution effects on human pulp tissues.        Methods: Primarily powder extracts were obtained by extracting fruit shells of S. mukorossi in different solvents (ethanol, methanol, buthanol and distilled water). The test solutions were prepared and randomly separated into six groups with 10 samples in each group: ethanol extract, methanol extract, butanol extract, distilled water extract of S. mukorossi, sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) and the control group. Among these, S. mukorossi extracts were separated into two subgroups, depending on their concentration level (50 mu g/mL and 100 mu g/mL). The pulp tissues of freshly extracted human molars were used for dissolution test. The weights of the pulpal tissues were measured and recorded for two times after the samples were placed in the solutions. Statistical analysis for all descriptive statistics was performed using SPSS 22 (P < 0.05).        Results: Our results showed that maximum percent yield of preparation was obtained in methanol extract of S. mukorossi. Among all of the groups, the best dissolution capacity was seen in the NaOCl group (positive control group). Among S. mukorossi groups, the best tissue solvent solution was found in SMM group at 50 mu g/mL and SMB group at 100 mu g/mL.        Conclusion: The different extracts of S. mukorossi had a capacity to dissolve pulp tissue but this capacity was less than NaOCl. Therefore, further studies will enable the creation of a commercial solution for clinical use by increasing the effectiveness of S. mukorossi while combining it with other endodontic irrigation solutions.

Experiment I compared the efficacy of two norgestomet ear implants (Crestar and Syncro-Mate B; SMB) for 9 d (with PGF at implant removal), combined with either 5 mg estradiol-17 beta and 100 mg progesterone (EP) or 5 mg EV and 3 mg norgestomet (EN) im at the time of implant insertion on CL diameter and follicular wave dynamics. Ovaries were monitored by ultrasonography. There was no effect of norgestomet implant. Diameter of the CL decreased following EN treatment (P < 0.01). Mean (+/- S.D.) day of follicular wave emergence (FWE) was earlier (P < 0.0001) and less variable (P < 0.0001) in EP- (3.6 +/- 0.5 d) than in EN- (5.7 +/- 1.5 d) treated heifers. Intervals from implant removal to estrus (P < 0.001) and ovulation (P < 0.01) were shorter in EN- (45.7 +/- 11.7 and 74.3 +/- 12.6 h, respectively) than in EP- (56.4 +/- 14.1 and 83.3 +/- 17.0 h, respectively) treated heifers. Experiment 2 compared the efficacy of EP versus EN in synchronizing FWE for superovulation in SMB-implanted cows. At random stages of the estrous cycle, Holstein cows (n = 78) received two SMB implants (Day 0) and were randomly assigned to receive EN on Day 0 or EP on Day 1. Folltropin-V treatments were initiated on the evening of Day 5, with PGF in the morning and evening of Day 8, when SMB were removed. Cows were inseminated after the onset of estrus and embryos were recovered 7 d later. Non-lactating cows had more CL (16.7 +/- 11.3 versus 8.3 +/- 4.9) and total ova/embryos (14.7 +/- 9.5 versus 7.9 +/- 4.6) than lactating cows (P < 0.05). EP-treated cows tended (P = 0.09) to yield more transferable embryos (5.6 +/- 5.2) than EN-treated cows (4.0 +/- 3.7). Experiment 3 compared the effect of dose of EV on ovarian follicle and CL growth profiles and synchrony of estrus and ovulation in CIDR-treated beef cows (n = 43). At random stages of the estrous cycle (Day 0), cows received a CIDR and no further treatment (Control), or an injection of 1, 2, or 5 mg im of EV. On Day 7, CIDR were removed and cows received PGF. Follicular wave emergence occurred within 7 d in 7/10 Control cows and 31/32 EV-treated cows (P < 0.05). In responding cows, interval from treatment to FWE was longer (P < 0.05) in those treated with 5 mg EV (4.8 +/- 1.2 d) than in those treated with I mg (3.2 +/- 0.9 d) or 2 mg (3.4 +/- 0.8 d) EV, while Control cows were intermediate (3.8 +/- 2.0 d). Diameter of the dominant follicle was smaller (P < 0.05) at CIDR removal and tended (P = 0.08) to be smaller just prior to ovulation in the 5 mg EV group (8.5 +/- 2.2 and 13.2 +/- 0.6 mm, respectively) than in the Control (11.8 +/- 4.6 and 15.5 +/- 2.9 mm, respectively) or I mg EV (11.7 +/- 2.5 and 15.1 +/- 2.2 mm, respectively) groups, with the 2 mg EV group (10.7 +/- 1.5 and 14.3 +/- 1.7 mm, respectively) intermediate. Diameter of the dominant follicle at CIDR removal was less variable (P < 0.01) in the 2 and 5 mg EV groups than in the Control group, and intermediate in the I mg EV group. In summary, treatment with 5 mg EV resulted in a longer and more variable interval to follicular wave emergence than treatment with 5 mg estradiol-17 beta, which affected preovulatory dominant follicle size following progestin removal, and may have also affected superstimulatory response in Holstein cows. Additionally, 5 mg EV appeared to induce luteolysis in heifers, reducing the interval to ovulation following norgestomet removal.        Conversely, ntervals to, and synchrony of, follicular wave emergence, estrus and ovulation following treatment with 1 or 2 mg EV suggested that reduced doses of EV may be more useful for the synchronization of follicular wave emergence in progestogen-treated cattle.

Components resulting from AM often suffer from rough surfaces and porosity defects. This complicates their response which must be understood for their service deployment. The core of the methodology used in this research is a workflow for generating various defects such as surface roughness and porosity analogous to those that naturally result from AM-fabricated lattices. Surface roughness is introduced by either discretizing a sinusoidal function or fitting experimental roughness data by Fourier Transforms. Porosity defects are implemented by drawing ellipses with assigned center position, radius and aspect ratio. A plane stress Finite Element Method (FEM) model is used under a uniform displacement boundary condition. Stress-strain and stiffness of the lattices are characterized as a function of the implanted defect. This methodology enables characterization of the effect of: (i) surface roughness, (ii) porosity defect density, (iii) porosity defect size, and (iv) algorithms with which random defects can be generated in simulated specimens. Effectiveness of this workflow also provides an efficient way to generate an adequate data pool for future machine learning and other data processing work. (c) 2020 The Authors.

Materials and Methods: In SME method, absorbance was measured at 299 and 259 nm for both the drugs. LCZ and GLA were estimated at 299 and 266 nm in the ASR method. First derivative (zero crossing) method depended on the change of UV spectra in to first derivative spectra followed by measurement of first derivative signal at 249 and 259 nm for LCZ and GLA, respectively, using 4 nm as wavelength interval (Delta lambda) and 4 as scaling factor. Developed methods were validated according to ICH guidelines including parameters, namely, specificity, linearity, range, precision and accuracy, limit of detection, and limit of quantification. Results and Discussion: All three techniques showed direct relation of absorbance in the concentration range of 1-30 mu g/ml for both the drugs.

The important parameters affecting extraction efficiency were completely studied and optimized. The experimental results showed that only 1.5 mg Nylon6 nanofibrous membrane could make the maximum sample loading volume up to 50 mL and the target analytes were adsorbed effectively. Under the optimized conditions, the limits of detection (LOD) for E2, EE2, E1 were up to 0.05, 0.08, 0.17 ng mL(-1) respectively and the repeatabilities (RSD%) of intra-membrane and inter-membrane were below 6.0% about spiked samples.

We examined whether its beta-lactamase interactions resembled those of the available carbapenems, i.e., stable to AmpC and extended-spectrum beta-lactamases but labile to class B and functional group 2f enzymes. The comparator drugs were imipenem, oral cephalosporins, and amoxicillin. MICs were determined for beta-lactamase expression variants, and hydrolysis was examined directly with representative enzymes. Sanfetrinem was a weak inducer of AmpC beta-lactamases below the MIC and had slight lability, with a k(cat) of 0.00033 s(-1) for the Enterobacter cloacae enzyme, Its MICs for AmpC-derepressed E. cloacae and Citrobacter freundii were 4 to 8 mu g/ml, compared with MICs of 0.12 to 2 mu g/ml for AmpC-inducible and -basal strains; MICs for AmpC-derepressed Serratia marcescens and Morganella morganii were not raised. Cefixime and cefpodoxime were more labile than sanfetrinem to the E. cloacae AmpC enzyme, and AmpC-derepressed mutants showed much greater resistance; imipenem was more stable and retained full activity against derepressed mutants. Like imipenem, sanfetrinem was stable to TEM-1 and TEM-10 enzymes and retained full activity against isolates and transconjugants with various extended-spectrum TEM and SHV enzymes, whereas these organisms were resistant to cefixime and cefpodoxime, Sanfetrinem, like imipenem and cefixime but unlike cefpodoxime, also retained activity against Proteus vulgaris and Klebsiella oxytoca strains that hyperproduced potent chromosomal class A beta-lactamases. Functional group 2f enzymes, including Sme-l, NMC-A, and an unnamed enzyme from Acinetobacter-spp., increased the sanfetrinem MICs by up to 64-fold. These enzymes also compromised the activities of imipenem and amoxicillin but not those of the cephalosporins. The hydrolysis of sanfetrinem was examined with a purified Sme-l enzyme, and biphasic kinetics were found, Finally, zinc beta-lactamases, including LMP-I and the L1 enzyme of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, conferred resistance to sanfetrinem and all other beta-lactams tested, and hydrolysis was confirmed with the IMP-1 enzyme, We conclude that sanfetrinem has beta-lactamase interactions similar to those of the available carbapenems except that it is a weaker inducer of AmpC types, with some tendency to select derepressed mutants, unlike imipenem and meropenem.",,10.1128/AAC.42.5.1168     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),ANTIBIOTIC-RESISTANCE;OUTER-MEMBRANE;PSEUDOMONAS-AERUGINOSA;ACID;INACTIVATION;KLEBSIELLA;BIAPENEM;PROTEINS;ENZYME,,,,,False,"The article focuses on the pharmacological properties of sanfetrinem and its interactions with beta-lactamase enzymes, which is unrelated to the use of AI, ML, DL, ANN, or NN in SMEs' operations."

Osmotic minipumps (Alza Corp.) containing 1.7 mg synthetic LHRH [luteinizing hormone releasing hormone] in 170 .mu.l saline were implanted s.c. into 4 sheep. Each ewe received 4 minipumps, implanted 1 wk apart. This treatment resulted in a relatively uniform level (54 .+-. 2 pg/ml, .hivin.X .+-. standard error of the mean) of LHRH-like immunoreactivity in plasma during the 4 wk period. After 4 wk, the sheep were killed and the stalk-median eminence (SME), hypothalamus proper (HP), preoptic-suprachiasmatic area (PO-SC), a sample of cerebral cortex (C) and the pineal gland (PG) were removed from the brain, homogenized in acidified ethanol and assayed for LHRH. Chronic exposure to LHRH was without effect on the contents of LHRH in the SME, HP or PO-SC, which were 50 .+-. 5, 5.1 .+-. 0.6 and 4.8 .+-. 0.8 ng, respectievely. LHRH was not detected in C. LHRH treatment did increase the content of LHRH in the PG (treated = 125 .+-. 24 pg, control = 80 .+-. 12 pg, P < 0.05). The midventral brain regions of the anestrous ewe do not take up or retain detectable amounts of exogenous LHRH. In contrast, the PG has this ability.

Accurately detecting operationally significant anomalies in operational data can save civilian lives and/or result in significant savings in aircraft/maintenance cost. The current practice uses manually tuned rule-based mechanisms to flag exceedances from pre-defined safety boundaries. However, this system cannot identify unknown risks and emerging vulnerabilities. Recently, innovative approaches based on data science and machine learning have been utilized to automate anomaly detection. However, there are limits to their applicability in the field of aviation due to several fundamental challenges: (1) Properly reviewed data is scarce in aviation and, as a result, supervised learning approaches cannot reach optimal performance. (2) Operationally significant anomalies do not coincide with statistically significant ones and, as a result, unsupervised learning approaches fail to provide reliable and robust performance. In this paper, we propose SALAD, a Semi-supervised Active Learning framework for Anomaly Detection, which detects operationally significant anomalies in flight operational quality assurance data. The developed framework works with vast amounts of unlabeled data as well as a small quantity of labeled data reviewed by subject matter experts (SMEs) to reliably identify safety anomalies in flight operations. Moreover, the model's active learning strategy allows it to detect unknown risks and anomalies that might emerge in the system earlier with the help of SME reviews. We validate performance of the SALAD framework and its components with a real-world case study of multi-class anomaly detection during the approach to landing of commercial aircraft.

In this study, we examined the incidence of these two sperm defects in two pig breeds, their effects on fertility and their associations with sperm morphology and testicular histology. Semen samples from 2048 (1097 Yorkshire, 951 Landrace) boars were collected. None of the Landrace boars revealed either the KA defect or the ISTS defect. Of the Yorkshire boars, 0.8% were afflicted with the KA defect and 7.6% with the ISTS defect. Boars diagnosed with the ISTS defect produced no litters. Fertility data were available from two artificially inseminated (AI) boars and six farm breeding boars affected with the KA defect. Breeding boars with 45-81% knobbed spermatozoa (n = 6) did not produce any litters out of 71 sows bred. AI boars with 25-30% knobbed spermatozoa had a poor non-return rate (on average 47% compared with 85% for normal control boars) and produced small litters, on average 2.5 piglets less than other boars of the same breed. Morphometry of testicular tissue and distribution of different cells in the seminiferous tubules were examined in nine boars. Boars with the KA defect had a smaller diameter of the seminiferous tubules (p < 0.05) and a lower number of Sertoli cells (p < 0.05) than controls. ISTS boars, in turn, had a significantly lower number of elongated spermatids (p < 0.05), and they also produced on average only 12% of the spermatozoa of normal boars.

Nickel-titanium (NiTi) is the most well-known alloy among the others due to its outstanding functional characteristics including superelasticity (SE) and shape memory effect (SME). These particular properties are the result of the reversible martensite-to-austenite and austenite-to-martensite transformations. In recent years, additive manufacturing (AM) has provided a great opportunity for fabricating NiTi products with complex shapes. Many researchers have been investigating the AM process to set the optimal operational parameters, which can significantly affect the properties of the end-products. Indeed, the functional and mechanical behavior of printed NiTi parts can be tailored by controlling laser power, laser scan speed, and hatch spacing having them a crucial role in properties of 3D-printed parts. In particular, the effect of the input parameters can significantly alter the mechanical properties such as strain recovery rates and the transformation temperatures; therefore, using suitable parameter combination is of paramount importance. In this framework, the present study develops a prediction model based on artificial neural network (ANN) to generate a nonlinear map between inputs and outputs of the AM process.

To facilitate the design of an SME model-based control system, a discrete-time transfer function that depicts the dynamic response of motor load (ML) to changes in SS is required. The research literature describes several off-line techniques for developing such transfer function models but no methods for on-line system identification were found. This paper- represents the first of two articles that describe our investigations into the use of on-line system identification for automatic tuning and adaptive control of a high-shear twin-screw extrusion process. This paper reports results for using various system identification schemes in combination with relay-feedback as a way to derive, in real-time, a transfer function model that accurately depicts the dynamical behavior of an extrusion cooking: process. A Wenger TX-52 co-rotating twin screw extruder was subjected to relay feedback during the processing of cornmeal for a breakfast cereal formula under different moisture and screw speed conditions. The data obtained from these experiments were used to derive first-, second- and third-order discrete-time transfer functions. An analysis of the resulting transfer functions revealed that a first-order lead-lag transfer function structure adequately described the dominant dynamic behavior of the process in all cases. Next, batch and recursive implementations of least-squares, extended least-squares, output error, maximum likelihood, Box-Jenkins and predictive error algorithms were used to derive parameters for the first-order transfer function. Overall, the batch output error method provided good transfer function estimates over the range of product and process conditions studied. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

However, uneven Na deposition and slow charge transfer kinetics still significantly impair their low temperature and rate performance. Herein, we report a non-solvating trifluoromethoxy benzene (PhOCF3) that modulates dipole-dipole interactions in the solvation structure. This modulation effectively reduces the affinity between Na* and solvents, promoting an anion-rich solvation sheath formation and significantly enhancing room temperature electrochemical performance in SMBs. Furthermore, temperature-dependent spectroscopic characterizations and molecular dynamics simulations reveal that these dipole-dipole interactions thermodynamically exclude solvent molecules from inner Na* solvation sphere at low temperatures, which endows the electrolyte with exceptional temperature adaptability, leading to remarkable improvement in low temperature SMB performance. Consequently, Na||Vanadium phosphate sodium (NVP) cells with the optimized electrolyte achieve 10,000 cycles at 10 C with capacity retention of 90.2% at 25 degrees C and over 650 cycles at 0.5 C with a capacity of 92.1 mA h g-1 at-40 degrees C.

Soil samples were analysed for a range of chemical, biological and physical properties including mineralizable N (MN) with a 7-day anaerobic incubation (AI-7). We identified and quantified by multivariate and regression analyses seven soil metabolites related to MN, namely glucose, trimethylamine, glutamic acid, serine, aspartic acid, 4-aminohippuric acid and citric acid. Glucose explained the largest percentage of the variation in MN (R-2=0.72). The amino acids, aspartic acid, 4-aminohippuric acid, glutamic acid and serine explained 39, 38, 27 and 19% of the variation in MN, respectively.

Study design a randomized, controlled trial. Methods: Patients from two communities were randomized into the intervention group (n = 53) or the control group (n = 52). The six-month intervention included the culturally tailored diabetes education and text-messaging support for behaviour changes. The control group received treatment as usual. The primary outcome was reductions in HbA(1c) and fasting blood glucose at six-month non-intervention follow-up. Secondary outcomes were reductions in body weight, body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, physical activity, and health beliefs. Results: The intervention led to substantially increase days of weekly physical activity (42% vs. 0%, P < 0.001) and health beliefs (coefficient = 7.0, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 4.4 to 9.6, P < 0.001). However, no greater reduction was found in HbA(1c) at six months after the intervention, compared with the control group (0.13%, 95% CI: -0.20 to 0.46, P = 0.443). The reductions of blood pressure, TC, and LDL-C were greater in the control group than in the intervention group (all P < 0.050). Within the intervention group, participants had significant reduction in BMI, whereas the control group had greater reductions in TC and LDL-C (all P < 0.050). Conclusions: The SME-TMS intervention led to a greater increase in the weekly physical activity and health belief score in the older patients at 6-month follow-up than with the usual care.

A cross-sectional analysis involving 173 owners/senior managers of SMEs in Canada was conducted to develop a conceptual model. Exploratory factor analysis and Cronbach's alpha were employed to assess the questionnaire's validity and reliability. Correlation, regression analysis, and Baron and Kenny's method were used to evaluate relationships and mediation effects. The findings revealed seven significant factors influencing SMEs' metaverse adoption intention. Notably, anxiety, security, and privacy did not impact adoption intention. Conversely, a positive correlation emerged between metaverse adoption intention and SME performance. The study demonstrated that metaverse adoption intention fully mediated the relationship between predictors and performance, with the indirect effect moderated by relationship qualities (RQs) like service experience and customer engagement.

Using the NIH and Habel potency tests to evaluate the protective activity of rabies vaccine, we observed that vaccinated mice showed a higher resistance to a challenge with a fixed rabies virus (CVS Challenge Virus Strain). The vaccine potency using the I-label or NIH tests was respectively > 6.4 (log 10) and 1.0 (Relative Potency-RP) when the fixed rabies virus was used for challenge, and from 2.9 to 4.3 (log 10) or 0.13 to 0.8 (RP) when different wild rabies viruses were used for challenge. The presence of virus neutralising antibodies (VNA) could not explain the differences of susceptibility after vaccination, since sera of vaccinated animals had similar VNA levels against both fixed and wild strains before virus challenge (respectively, 5.6 +/- 0.24 and 5.0 +/- 0.25 IU/ml of VNA against the fixed rabies virus and the 566-M strain of wild rabies virus in sera of mice vaccinated with 0.2 units of vaccine).

Methods        The first study had an open, single-dose, three-treatment, three-period, six-sequence, randomised, crossover design with at least a five-day wash-out. The second study had an open, steady-state, two-treatment, two-period, two-sequence, randomised crossover design with at least a seven-day wash-out. Both studies contained 30 healthy subjects. Both enantiomers of tramadol and O-demethyl-tramadol (the only active metabolite of tramadol) were assayed in the plasma using an LC-MS/MS method.

The present study was designed to investigate the antihyperglycemic effect of the ethanolic seed extract of Swietenia macrophylla (SME) in normal and STZ-diabetic rats. Materials and Methods: The experimental groups were rendered diabetic by intraperitoneal injection of a single dose of STZ (40 mg/kg body weight [BW]). Rats with glucose levels > 200 mg/dL were considered diabetic and were divided into 5 groups. Three groups of diabetic animals were orally administered, daily with seed extract at a dosage of 50, 100, and 200 mg/kg BW. One group of STZ rats was treated as diabetic control and the other group was orally administered 600 g/kg BW glibenclamide daily. Results: Graded doses of seed extract and glibenclamide showed a significant reduction in blood glucose levels and improvement in serum insulin levels. The extract also improved body weight and promoted liver glycogen content. After treatment, hemoglobin (Hb) level increased and glycosylated Hb level significantly decreased in diabetic rats. The activities of the carbohydrate metabolic enzymes showed significant changes in the rats. Of the 3 doses, 100 mg dose showed maximum activity.

We examined whether intestinal fatty acid binding protein (I-FABP) might serve as a biomarker for early detection of Me-Is following cardiac surgery. Between March 2022 and December 2023, we conducted a prospective observational study of 500 consecutive patients undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass. Blood samples were obtained at five time points perioperatively. An immunoassay was used to determine I-FABP levels in 48 individuals at high risk of Me-Is due to lactic acidosis > 4 mmol/L and interleukin (IL)-6 > 600 pg/mL: 6 patients with confirmed Me-Is (cMe-Is), 18 patients with suspected Me-Is (sMe-Is), and 24 patients a in propensity score-matched control group. Of the 48 patients, 62.5% initially had mild gastrointestinal dysfunction (AGI <= II), but 80% of them progressed to AGI III or higher, with 25% reaching AGI IV. Baseline serum I-FABP values were similar between the three groups. The six patients with cMe-Is showed significantly elevated serum I-FABP levels from ICU admission to 36 h post-admission, peaking at 207,411.46 pg/mL. ROC analysis identified serum I-FABP as the most accurate predictor of Me-Is, with an AUC of 0.973 at 36 h post-ICU admission (95% CI [0.764-0.997], p < 0.001) and an optimal cut-off of > 1421 pg/mL, with 100% sensitivity. In contrast, IL-6 and lactate levels showed no significant differences between groups. Serum I-FABP showed high accuracy in predicting Me-Is after cardiac surgery, outperforming IL-6 and lactate.

Materials with such an interesting effect are known as shape memory materials (SMMs). Typical stimuli to trigger shape recovery include temperature (heating or cooling), chemical (including water/moisture and pH value), and light. As a SMM is able not only to maintain the temporary shape but also to respond to the right stimulus when it is applied, via shape-shifting, a seamless integration of sensing and actuation functions is achieved within one single piece of material.        Hydrogels are defined by their ability to absorb a large amount of water (from 10-20% up to thousands of times their dry weight), which results in significant swelling. On the other hand, dry hydrogels indeed belong to polymers, so they exhibit heat and chemoresponsive SMEs as most polymers do. While heat-responsive SMEs have been spotted in a handful of wet hydrogels, so far, most dry hydrogels evince the heat and water (moisture)-responsive SMEs.        Since water is one of the major components in living biological systems, water-responsive SMMs hold great potential for various implantable applications, including wound healing, intravascular devices, soft tissue reconstruction, and controlled drug delivery. This provides motivation to combine water-activated SMEs and swelling in hydrogels together to enhance the performance. In many applications, such as vascular occlusion via minimally invasive surgery for liver cancer treatment, the operation time (for both start and finish) is required to be well controlled. Due to the gradual and slow manner of water absorption for water activated SMEs and swelling in hydrogels, even a combination of both effects encounters many difficulties to meet the time requirements in real procedures of vascular occlusion.        Recently, we have reported a bioabsorbable radiopaque water-responsive shape memory embolization plug for temporary vascular occlusion. The plug consists of a composite with a poly(DL-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) core (loaded with radiopaque filler) and cross-linked poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) hydrogel outer layer. The device can be activated by body fluid (or water) after about 2 min of immersion in water. The whole occlusion process is completed within a few dozens of seconds. The underlying mechanism is water-responsive shape recovery induced buckling, which occurs in an expeditious manner within a short time period and does not require complete hydration of the whole hydrogel.        In this paper, we experimentally and analytically investigate the water-activated shape recovery induced buckling in this biodegradable PEG hydrogel to understand the fundamentals in precisely controlling the buckling time. The molecular mechanism responsible for the water-induced SME in PEG hydrogel is also elucidated. The original diameter and amount of prestretching are identified as two influential parameters to tailor the buckling time between 1 and 4 min as confirmed by both experiments and simulation.        The phenomenon reported here, chemically induced buckling via a combination of the SME and swelling, is generic, and the study reported here should be applicable to other water- and non-water-responsive gels.",,10.1021/acs.accounts.6b00539     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),MEMORY;TOUGH;EMBOLIZATION;TEMPERATURE;INSTABILITY;TRANSITION;POLYMERS;MOISTURE,,,,,False,"The article focuses on shape memory materials and hydrogels for biomedical applications, not on AI, ML, DL, or neural networks in SMEs."

In experiment 2, estrus was synchronized with Lutalyse, a Controlled Intravaginal Progesterone Releasing Device (CIDR), or cows were not synchronized. Corpora lutea were collected, weighed, and luteal slices were weighed, diced and incubated in vitro with treatments. Treatments (100 ng/ml) were: vehicle, L-NAME, L-NMMA, DETA, DETA-NONOate, sodium nitroprusside, S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP) or endothelin-1. Tissues were incubated in M-199 for 1 h without treatments and for 4 and 8 h in both experiments with treatments in both experiments. Media were analyzed for progesterone, prostaglandins E-2 and F(2)alpha (PGE(2), PGF(2)alpha) by radioimmunoassay (RIA). Hormone data in experiments 1 and 2 were analyzed by 2 x 7 and 3 x 2 x 8 factorial design for analysis of variance (ANOVA), respectively. Luteal weights in experiment 2 were analyzed by a one-way ANOVA. Concentrations of progesterone in media were similar (P greater than or equal to 0.05) among treatments within experiments. Concentrations of PGE(2) in media in experiment 1 were undetectable in 90 and 57% of the samples at 4 and 8 h, respectively. PGF(2)alpha increased (P less than or equal to 0.05) with time, but did not differ (P greater than or equal to 0.05) among treatments. Secretion of PGF(2)alpha was not affected by treatments (P greater than or equal to 0.05). In experiment 2, luteal weights of the induced estrous cycle were decreased (P less than or equal to 0.05) by Lutalyse. Concentrations of PGE(2) and PGF(2)alpha increased (P less than or equal to 0.05) with time in control of all three synchronization regimens. DETA-NONOate, SNAP, sodium nitroprusside (NO donors) and ET-1 increased (P less than or equal to 0.05) PGE(2) except in the CIDR synchronized group (P greater than or equal to 0.05). No treatment increased (P greater than or equal to 0.05) PGF(2)alpha in any synchronization regimen. It is concluded that either SMB containing norgestomet or a CIDR containing progesterone alters luteal secretion of PGE(2), Lutalyse lowers luteal weights in the induced estrous cycle, and NO or ET-1 given alone are not luteolytic agents. It is suggested that NO and ET-1 could have indirect antiluteolytic/luteotropic effects via increasing PGE(2) secretion by luteal tissue rather than being luteolytic. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

The experiment was performed on 22 prepubertal gilts (Large White), at 155 days of age (mean +/- SD body weight 60.1 +/- 3.4 kg). The animals were randomly assigned to two groups: one received 5 mg of PRL (BIOLACTIN, Biochefa, Sosnowiec, Poland, n = 11) and the other received saline (n = 11) i.m. once a day for 21 days. Blood samples were collected from the jugular vein three times a day during the first 2 weeks, four times a day in the third week of the study, additionally every 20 min for 4 h (08:00-12:00 h) and every 2 h for 8 h on days 1, 7, 15 and 21 of the experiment. Concentrations of PRL and LH in plasma and GnRH in medium were analyzed by radioimmunoassay (RIA) procedures. All gilts were slaughtered on the 21st day of treatment. Ovaries and hypothalamus were dissected immediately following slaughter.        Mean concentrations of LH in the consecutive weeks of the study were similar in the PRL-treated gilts whereas in the control animals they rose significantly (from 0.29 +/- 0.02 ng ml(-1) the first week to 0.40 +/- 0.02 ng ml(-1) in the third week; P < 0.01). Exogenous PRL increased mean LH concentrations during the whole period of the experiment (P < 0.01) but did not affect the frequency, amplitude or duration of the LH peaks. In the ovaries of hyperprolactinemic animals the concentration of LH/hCG receptors increased compared with control gilts (from 1.95 +/- 0.43 fmol mg(-1) to 2.39 +/- 0.55 fmol mg(-1) of protein). Dissociation constants for hyperprolactinemic and control groups were similar. In vitro, basal and potassium-stimulated release of GnRH from the SME did not differ between the treated and control groups.

GC-MS analysis showed that the compound concentrations were dependent on the polarity of extracting solvent SMH (34), SMDCM (36), SMEA (12), SME (50) and SMM (36). Toluene (15.13%) and di-isooctyl phthalate (14.21%) were identified as the basic constituents of SMH. In SMDCM, n-nonadecanol-1 (19.64%) and eicosane (13.93%) were the main compounds, while in SMEA it was ethanol, 2-butoxy-(83.29%). Both SME and SMM showed the presence of Tetradecyl trifluoroacetate (15.43%). Pentadecanoic acid (12.18%), Propane, 2,2-diethoxy- (33.83%) and o-Xylene (15.87%). The identified antiviral compounds in the crude extracts, were d-Limonene (1.33%), p-Cymene (1.31%), Thymol (0.50%) and Carvacrol (0.87%) in SMM and SMH extracts, with Phytol, acetate being a common constituent in all the essential oils, except SMEA. In vitro cytotoxicity studies of crude S. mombin leaf extracts were performed using the MTT method in three cell lines: MCF-7, A-549 and HEK-293, with IC50 values between 15.91 and 178.5 mu g/mL. Therefore, the results indicated that crude extracts from S. mombin leafs had low toxicity and could be used safely. Compared with hexane extracts (1), methanol extracts have more compounds with antiviral properties (3) and can be used as reusable therapeutic candidates, natural dietary supplements or in the fight against SARS-CoV-2, Ebola and Marburg viruses.

In electrochemistry where the reactants must contact electrode surfaces for a sufficient time to enable electron tunnelling to occur, exhaustive electrolysis in poorly stirred reactors can take many hours to complete. As a consequence, electrochemical processing in many industries is restricted to batch processing which is more costly and labour intensive than continuous processing and results in significant down time between batches. This is not ideal for bulk production or treatment. Here we describe CSIRO's novel axial flow electrochemical cell which aims to address these mixing problems by using a bespoke static mixer electrode (SME), designed by computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and manufactured using additive manufacturing (AM) technology to retain the fidelity of the original design. This electrode was characterized by SEM-EDS and electrosorption measurements. The performance of the electrochemical flow cell was evaluated by probing the ferricyanide ([Fe(CN)(6)](3-)) reduction reaction on a platinum-coated SME under controlled mass transport conditions using cyclic voltammetry (CV), linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) and chronoamperometric measurements. This reaction was chosen because it has fast electron transfer kinetics, so the rate of reaction in dilute solutions is limited only by mass transport of the reactant to the electrode surface. Under the highest flow rate used (400 ml min(-1)) the cell enhanced the rate of reduction of ([Fe(CN)(6)](3-) in a 10(-3) M solution by 45 times compared with the no flow result. The impact the cell has diminishes as the concentration increases where mass transport plays a diminishing role in controlling the reaction rate. The performance of the cell is compared with a rotating disk electrode and a tubular flow cell and mass transfer coefficients are also presented for different reactant concentrations and flow conditions.

Extrusion conditions investigated were barrel temperature (70 - 130 degrees C), screw speed (70-190 rpm), enzyme concentration (0-1%) and feed moisture content (28.5-50.5%). Feed moisture, barrel temperature and enzyme concentration had significant effects on saccharification, which ranged from 32 to 98% (dextrose equivalent = 83-98) after 8 h reaction with 0.50 AGU/ml amyloglucosidase (AMG). Die pressure tvas negatively correlated with saccharification (r = -0.75), implying that products formed from a high viscous mass were poorly saccharified. Greater extent of saccharification was achieved with lower SME input. Saccharification in the extruder was initiated by adding AMG during the extrusion processing. Both initial and subsequent saccharification were dependent on the AMG concentration, moisture content and the stage of AMG addition. In this mixed-enzyme system, synergistic effects of both enzymes (alpha-amylase and amyloglucosidase) were evident. High performance size-exclusion chromatography profiles showed that incorporating AMG led to loss of G6 and G2 in the oligosaccharide spectra but with formation of G5.

It is therefore necessary to know how to minimize the burr size in both the design and in process planning phases of machine parts. Electrochemical deburring (ECD) is now providing a simple and economical approach to selectively removing burrs from inaccessible areas with consistent results and absolute uniformity. It has many great advantages as mentioned by several investigators [Adachi et al., A study on burr in low frequency vibratory drilling, in: Proceedings of the Fifth International Conference on Production Engineering, Tokyo, 1984, pp. 246-251: Nakayama, Ann.

ECD systems have been developed to handle pieces in every way from manually one part at a time, to completely automated transfer lines processing several pieces at a time. In order to achieve maximum productivity and minimum cost of drilling and ECD of a hole, it is necessary to drill under such conditions which give least possible burr height.        The aim of the present investigation is therefore to find out the best combination of drilling and enlarging as well as chamfering prior to enlarging, which minimizes the obtained burr size. A flowchart is developed for the determination of the optimum conditions of drilling with minimum manufacturing cost from the point of view of burr formation. It enables also the evaluation of the ECD time to obtain the required deburring radius with minimum cost for drilling followed by ECD, especially in case of drilling intersecting holes.

The MICs of multiple antibiotics administered intravenously only (ceftazidime, piperacillin, cefepime, ceftolozane, and meropenem) and orally bioavailable antibiotics (ceftibuten, cefpodoxime, tebipenem) alone and in combination with QPX7728 (4 mu g/ml), as well as comparator agents, were determined against panels of laboratory strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae expressing over 55 diverse serine and metallo-beta-lactamases.

Herein, a separator with multifunctional layers composed of N-doped mesoporous hollow carbon spheres (HCS) as the inner layer and sodium fluoride (NaF) as the outer layer on commercial polypropylene separator (PP) is proposed (PP@HCS-NaF) to achieve stable cycling in SMB. At the molecular level, the inner HCS layer with a high content of pyrrolic-N induces the uniform Na* flux as a potential Na* redistributor for homogenous deposition, whereas its hollow mesoporous structure offers nanoporous buffers and ion channels to regulate Na* ion distribution and uniform deposition. The outer layer (NaF) constructs the NaF-enriched robust solid electrolyte interphase layer, significantly lowering the Na* ions diffusion barrier. Benefiting from these merits, higher electrochemical performances are achieved with multifunctional double-layered PP@HCS-NaF separators compared with single-layered separators (i.e. PP@HCS or PP@NaF) in SMBs. The Na||Cu half-cell with PP@HCS-NaF offers stable cycling (280 cycles) with a high CE (99.6%), and Na||Na symmetric cells demonstrate extended lifespans for over 6000 h at 1 mA cm(-2) with a progressively stable overpotential of 9 mV. Remarkably, in Na||NVP full-cells, the PP@HCS-NaF separator grants a stable capacity of 81 mA h g(-1) after 3500 cycles at 1 C and an impressive rate capability performance (similar to 70 mA h g(-1) at 15 C).

For a given adsorbent volume and product purity requirements, throughput and desorbent consumption depend on desorbent composition, column configuration, column length to diameter ratio, and adsorbent particle size. In this study, these design parameters are systematically examined for paclitaxel purification. The results show that if adsorbent particle size, column dimensions and column configuration are fixed, the higher the product purity required, the lower the throughput. If product purity and yield are fixed, the larger the solute migration speed ratio, the higher the throughput, and the lower the desorbent consumption. If total bed volume and product purities are fixed, the longer the separation zones, the higher the throughput, but the higher the desorbent flow-rate. An intermediate configuration gives the minimum desorbent consumption. If there are no limits on pressure drop or zone flow-rate, the larger the column length to diameter ratio, the smaller the adsorbent particle size, the higher the throughput, and the lower the desorbent consumption. If the maximum zone flow-rate is controlled by the pressure drop limit and not by the standing waves requirement, the longer the columns, the lower the zone flow-rates and the lower the throughput. For 150-mu m adsorbent particles and a maximum zone flow-rate of 300 ml/min, a design with optimal throughput and desorbent consumption is found for paclitaxel purification.

We analyzed the contribution of SmeABC and SmeDEF efflux pumps to levofloxacin resistance in clinical isolates of S. maltophilia.

To determine which antimicrobials were affected by smeD overexpression, the growth rates of a levofloxacin-susceptible S. maltophilia isolate were compared by measuring absorbance of antimicrobial-supplemented Luria-Bertani broth (LB) cultures with or without triclosan.

Those that were between days 9 and 12 of their cycle (estrus = day 0) formed the TI group (n = 60), whilst those that were in any other stages of their estrus cycle constituted groups TII (n = 60) and TIE (n = 60). TI donors were submitted to a standard protocol of superovulation, however, TII and TIII donors were treated with the Syncro-Mate-B (SMB) or Controlled Internal Drug Releasing Device (CIDR-B) programs, respectively. Superovulation was induced with p-FSH, divided into eight decreasing doses at intervals of 12 h. The donors received cloprostenol 48 h after the beginning of the treatment and progestagens were removed 12 h later. Artificial inseminations (AI) were done at 12 and 22 h after the initiation of estrus and the embryo collections were done 7 days after AI. In the donors which displayed behavioral estrus, mean (+/-S.E.M.) total ova and viable (transferable) embryos were 15.8 +/- 1.4 and 8.3 +/- 1.0 (TI, n = 56); 15.6 +/- 1.3 and 8.9 +/- 1.0 (TII, n = 56); 17.3 +/- 1.0 and 9.9 +/- 0.9 (TIII, n = 57), respectively, with no significant difference (P greater than or equal to 0.05) among groups. In those animals that did not displayed behavioral estrus, the mean values of total ova and viable embryos were 3.5 +/- 1.6 and 0.7 +/- 0.5 (TI, n = 4); 11.5 +/- 3.9 and 9.0 +/- 4.4 (TII, n = 4); 8.7 +/- 5.0 and 5.0 +/- 2.9 (TIII, n = 3), respectively, with no significant differences (P greater than or equal to 0.05) among groups. Pregnancy rates of 62.2% (TI, n = 235); 66.4% (TII, n = 284) and 65.1% (TIII, n = 244) were obtained with embryos transferred from these collections and did not differ significantly (P greater than or equal to 0.05) among groups. It was concluded that the synchronization of the emergence of follicular waves in Nelore donors is usable and does not harm the efficiency of embryo transfer programs. In addition, in contrast to the standard superovulation protocol, this method permits the use of a large number of donors in a short time period, at any stage of the estrus cycle, minimizing the costs of embryo transfer.

To complement that, laser polishing (LP) is one of the advanced manufacturing surface finishing techniques that has been recently developed and successfully employed for improving surface quality without deteriorating the overall structural form through surface smoothing by melting and redistributing a thin layer of molten material. This paper proposes a statistical digital twin of the LP process and demonstrates the applicability of amplitude distribution statistical characteristics in the experimental analysis of surface topography formation during LP process. Initially, the thermodynamic transformation of the initial surface topography is considered by means of technical cybernetics and machine learning approaches to describe two of the most critical LP process components, namely: thermodynamic melting and solidification of both solid material and surface topography. To exemplify the effective application of statistical amplitude distribution characteristics, LP experiments were conducted with two different laser powers (25 W and 100 W) on flat and ground initial surfaces and resulting surface topographies were measured. Several amplitude distribution characteristics, such as roughness average value, averaged transverse profile as a W-shape, averaged transverse roughness profile, and probability distribution function were calculated. After that, actual molten material area, volume redistribution and final surface quality were comparatively analyzed. It was shown that the proportion between two components of the LP thermodynamic transformation and surface topography is critically dependent on laser power. As such, during low-power conditions (< 25 W), surface quality is predominantly determined by the thermodynamic transformation of initial surface topography and therefore only this component can be used for statistically reliable LP process modelling and digital identification. In summary, amplitude distribution characteristics have several advantages in building a comprehensive understanding of the molten material redistributing along and across LP line.

Similar reaction of MoO2Cl2 with the diselenoether MeSe(CH2)(2)SeMe gives the very reactive [MoO2Cl2{MeSe(CH2)(2)SeMe}] as a yellow solid. These compounds are very moisture sensitive and were characterised by IR, diffuse reflectance UV-vis and multinuclear (H-1, C-13{H-1}, Se-77 and Mo-95) NMR spectroscopy. The data are consistent with distorted 6-coordination at Mo(VI) via trans X ligands, mutually cis oxo groups and a chelating dithio- or diseleno-ether ligand. Variable temperature H-1 and C-13{H-1} NMR data indicate fast pyramidal inversion at the coordinated chalcogen atoms occurs at room temperature, but cooling slows this process to reveal resonances consistent with the meso and DL forms. The Mo-95 NMR spectra are single resonances in the region 200-300 ppm, as expected for Mo( VI) complexes, and show inverse dependence of the chemical shifts upon both halide and chalcogen type. Crystal structures of three of the dithioether complexes are described and provide unequivocal evidence for Mo( VI) thioether coordination, confirming chelation of the dithioether through long Mo-S interactions of ca. 2.7 Angstrom.

Both viruses were recovered during silent interepidemic periods, and it is believed these viruses are maintained in this region in sylvatic conditions. The recovered virus strains were detected within 24-48 h in SMB [suckling mouse brain] and [African green monkey kidney] Vero cell monolayer cultures, and the sentinel hamsters yielded virus infectivities up to 104 PFU [plaque forming units]/ml. The VEE isolate (IVIC PAn 23645-47) recovered during the silent interepizodemic period had an elution profile on the hydroxylapatite column corresponding to that of a I-D (VEE-3880) or a I-E (VEE-63A216) enzootic subtype.

COBOT simplifies path planning in patterned additive manufacturing by using teaching points where a complex deposition pattern can be represented by a few key coordinates. However, the selection of teaching points significantly affects the temperature fields, deposit geometry, residual stresses, and distortion, and these effects are not well understood. Here we use a combined experimental and computational approach to study the effects of four patterns with different teaching points (4, 5, 6, and 8) during wire arc-directed energy deposition (WA-DED) of stainless steel. Experiments are performed using an in-house COBOT-assisted WA-DED system. Finite element modeling is done to compute temperature fields, deposit geometry, residual stresses, and distortion. We concluded that the distribution of residual stress varies notably with different deposition patterns, even though the maximum stress values are not significantly different. Stress tends to accumulate at sharp corners where the arc heat source stays longer. In addition, thermal distortion is present in all parts due to variations in the temperature field, with the highest distortion occurring farthest from the molten pool. However, overall distortion remains comparable across parts due to a consistent total heat input. (c) 2025 Society of Manufacturing Engineers (SME). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Methods One hundred volunteers aged 50 years old or older were randomized to receive either one drinkable ampoule containing 25,000 IU vitamin D3 (D-Cure (R), SMB) once monthly (group VD) or one chewable tablet containing 1000 mg calcium carbonate + 800 IU vitamin D3 (Steovit Forte (R), Takeda) once daily (group VDCa) during 6 months. After the first 6 months of treatment, the groups were reversed according to the randomized cross-over design. Treatment compliance (i.e. the primary outcome), preference, acceptability and vitamin D levels and adverse events were all collected.        Results For the two periods, the patients had a significantly higher compliance in the VD group than in the VDCa group (p < 0.0001).

It is generally admitted that future competitiveness of European industry and commerce will heavily rely on the success of the efforts to harness and adapt these technologies to meeting the growing demand for lifelong learning. But this is not just an industrial concern, the social and cultural challenges are equally important; peripheral regions, SME's, rural areas, the unemployed, the handicapped are some amongst many other groups which require affordable solutions to their particular needs.        How to realize these potentials? Many different avenues have been explored in the past. For the first time, a European research action was launched to tackle the issue: the DELTA (Developing European Learning through Technological Advance) Exploratory Action brought together a number of projects covering a broad sample of technological options: from applications of Artificial Intelligence for stand-alone systems to multimedia communications for distance learning. The approach was to mobilise the different assets in this multidisciplinary field and to put them to work towards a common goal, to draw-up a common European agenda.        The results achieved led to the successful launching of the new action ''Telematics Systems for Flexible and Distance Learning''. The goal was to pave the way for the implementation of technology-based learning infrastructures which would enable Europe to reap the benefits already foreseen in the previous research. Issues such as improving performance of design and production systems, catering for more flexibility in the delivery and provision of remote access to learning resources will ease the uptake of learning technologies. Nevertheless, many questions are still open, such as which systems and technologies are best suited to the particular needs of the end-users; how the performance of these systems should be evaluated; how to build consensus on standards for the future Europe-wide delivery systems. These, among others, are the questions which the new action is striving to answer.        Systems using Broadband-ISDN, VSAT networks, computer conferencing, multimedia, hypermedia, etc. are being prototyped and tested to ascertain their suitability for learning purposes. Many possibilities are being experimented, from the intelligent simulations for on-the-job learning for individual users to the knowledge networks based on computer conferencing or virtual classrooms designed to meet the needs of distributed groups. Future learning services will make use of the technologies and systems under development, but even more importantly, several pilot experiments are committed to provide evidence of good practices, under a common evaluation framework, and consequently to provide an answer to some of the key questions stated above.

Neisseria gonorrhoeae has developed resistance to all first-line recommended therapies, making gonococcal antimicrobial resistance a major public health concern given limited antibiotic options currently and an even smaller antimicrobial development pipeline. Since the release of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 2015 STD Treatment Guidelines, azithromycin, part of the 2015 dual-drug treatment regimen, has had a rapid rise in resistance. The 2020 CDC Gonorrhea Treatment Recommendations and the 2021 Sexually Transmitted Infections (STI) Treatment Guidelines were developed weighing the priorities of treating the individual, protecting the population, and preventing antimicrobial resistance.        Methods. Gonorrhea subject matter experts (SME) generated 8 key questions and conducted a literature review of updated data from 2013 to 2019 on gonorrhea antimicrobial resistance, treatment failures, clinical trials, and other key topics. More than 2200 abstracts were assessed, and 248 clinically relevant articles were thoroughly reviewed. SMEs also evaluated Ngonorrhoeae antimicrobial resistance data from the Gonococcal Isolate Surveillance Project (GISP).        Evidence. Although there have been reports of ceftriaxone treatment failures internationally, GISP data suggest that ceftriaxone minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) have remained stable in the United States, with < 0.1% exhibiting an ""alert value"" MIC (> 0.25 mcg/mL). However, GISP documented a rapid rise in the proportion of isolates with an elevated MIC (>= 2.0 mcg/mL) to azithromycin-nearly 5% in 2018. At the same time, new pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic data are available, and there is greater recognition of the need for antimicrobial stewardship.        Summary. The 2021 CDC STI Treatment Guidelines now recommend 500 mg ceftriaxone intramuscularly once for the treatment of uncomplicated gonorrhea at all anatomic sites.

On Day 1, sows had fewer (P < 0.05) small follicles (< 4 mm diameter), but more (P < 0.05) medium (4-6 mm) and large (> 6 mm) follicles, than sows on Day 7 (20 +/- 2, 6.5 +/- 1.1, and 2.5 +/- 0.7 vs. 26.3 +/- 3, 0, and 0, respectively). Serum LH and FSH decreased (p < 0.04) during the period from 24 to 48 h postpartum and remained low through Day 7. GnRH concentrations in POA MBH, and SME and the proportion of residual GnRH released in vitro in response to Kf did not differ between Day 1 and 7. Weights of AP were not different, but pituitary concentrations (mu g/mg) of W and FSH increased (P < 0.05) from Day 1 to 7 (LH: 0.27 +/- 0.03 vs. 0.44 +/- 0.01; FSH: 2.6 +/- 0.07 vs. 7.8 +/- 0.8, respectively). In experiment 2, we hypothesized that the suckling-induced inhibition of LH would be accompanied by changes in readily releasable pools of GnRH, LH, and FSH. Sows were administered (i.v.) either saline (control; n = 5) or the neuroexcitatory amino acid N-methyl-D,L aspartic acid (NMA; 10 mg/kg BW; n = 5) to estimate releasable pools of GnRH. NMA was given at Days 1 and 7 of lactation, and blood was taken every 10 min for 2 h before and after treatment. Sows given saline at 0 h received a GnRH bolus (100 mu g, i.v.) 2 h later to estimate releasable pools of gonadotropins. To estimate releasable pools of GnRH, the LH and FSH responses to NMA were quantified by area under the curve (ng ml-L min). Basal LH (mu g/ml) was greater (P < 0.05) at Day 1 (1.63 +/- 0.04) than at Day 7 (1.22 +/- 0.03), but basal FSH secretion did not differ between days. The LH response to NMA was similar at Days 1 and 7 (96.5 +/- 5.7 vs. 99.9 +/- 10.4), whereas NMA-induced FSH release was greater (p < 0.05) at Day 7 than at Day 1 (2897 +/- 559 vs. 1821 +/- 245). Similarly, GnRH-induced LH secretion (ng/ml) was not different between groups (3.13 +/- 0.2 vs. 3.1 +/- 0.1 for Days 1 and 7), but more (P < 0.05) FSH was released at Day 7 (92.2 +/- 3.8) than at Day 1 (56.4 +/- 5.6). These results indicate that in multiparous sows: 1) the inhibitory effect of suckling on estimated secretion of GnRH and secretion of gonadotropins is established within 24-48 h postpartum; 2) basal LH decreases from Day 1 to 7 and readily releasable pools of LH remain constant; 3) basal FSH does nor change from Day 1 to 7, but readily releasable pools of FSH increase; and 4) the estimated readily releasable pool of GnRH remains constant from Day 1 to 7. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that suckling decreases GnRH secretion, thereby altering the ratios of basal concentrations and releasable pools of LH and FSH.",,10.1095/biolreprod50.5.1078     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),FOLLICLE-STIMULATING-HORMONE;D-ASPARTATE RECEPTORS;LUTEINIZING-HORMONE;PROLACTIN SECRETION;LACTATING SOWS;WEANED SOWS;ESTROGEN;ESTRUS;PIGS;RESPONSES,,,,,False,"The article focuses on hormonal changes in postpartum sows and does not address AI, ML, DL, ANN, or NN use in SMEs or their impact on organizational performance."

At present grinding appears to be the only practical and economical means of shaping the parts into the final products with fine surface finish, acceptable surface integrity, and high geometric accuracy (Kovach, J. (1987). Improved grinding of ceramic components. In: Proceedings of the Department of Defence, Machine Tool/ Manufacturing Development Conference. AFWAL-TR-4137, Vol. 7, 72-100). In the machining of conventional materials, grinding is also usually used as a finishing operation when high accuracy and surface finish is required, and usually determines the major portion of the processing cost. Despite this importance and popularity, grinding still remains as one of the most difficult to control processes. Unlike machining processes where cutting is performed by a defined single/ multiple cutting edge(s), grinding is performed by a number of abrasive grits, which are randomly oriented within a grinding wheel. Therefore, it is impossible to maintain or control the shape of these hard grits, which are active in the cutting process (Malkin, S. (1989). Grinding Technology, Theory and Applications of Machining with Abrasives, Chister, England: Ellis Horwood Limited; Okafor, A. C., Marcus, M., Tipirneni, R. (1990). Multiple sensor integration via neural networks for estimating surface roughness and bore tolerance in circular end milling. Transaction of NAMRI/SME 128-136). Grinding is a very complicated process, consisting of complex interactions between a large numbers of variables. These variables can be grouped into four major categories: (a) machine tool, (b) workpiece material, (c) grinding wheel, and (d) operating parameters (Allor, R. L. Whalen, T. J., Baer, J. R., Kumar, K. V. (1993). Machining of silicon nitride: experimental determination of process/property relationships.

Modelling of ceramic grinding processes, number of cutting points and grinding forces per grit. Journal of Materials Processing Technology 65(1-3):1-10). The dressing and truing processes used to prepare the wheel have an important effect on the grinding wheel variables and consequently on the output of the grinding process. To achieve this understanding, many researchers focused on the modeling of grinding processes. Some of these models are completely theoretical, and others are practical with theoretical explanations and empirical equations. The aim of this research was to find the relationship between the process variables, the process parameters, and workpiece quality. This review presents the theoretical and experimental models used, process design algorithms, expert systems, artificial intelligent algorithms, fuzzy logic and neural network algorithms, process monitoring and control, and in particular artificial intelligence control systems.",,10.1081/LMST-200028748     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),grinding;intelligent control;neural networks;dressing,,,,,False,"The article focuses on grinding processes and manufacturing, with only a peripheral mention of neural networks in process control, not on AI/ML/DL use in SMEs or their organizational impact."

The aim of this study was to evaluate the anti-methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) activity of cationic nanostructured lipid carriers (NLC) combined with oxacillin against ATCC 33591 and clinical isolate. The cationic resource on the NLC surface was soyaethyl morpholinium ethosulfate (SME). NLC loaded with oxacillin was produced to assess the antibacterial activity and the effectiveness of topical application for treating cutaneous infection. The hydrodynamic diameter and zeta potential of oxacillin-loaded NLC were 177 nm and 19 mV, respectively. When combined with NLC, oxacillin exhibited synergistic MRSA eradication. After NLC encapsulation, the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of oxacillin decreased from 250 to 62.5 mu/ml. The combined NLC and oxacillin reduced the MRSA biofilm thickness from 31.2 to 13.0 mu m, which was lower than the effect of NLC (18.2 mu m) and antibiotic (25.2 mu m) alone. The oxacillin-loaded NLC showed significant reduction in the burden of intracellular MRSA in differentiated THP-1 cells. This reduction was greater than that achieved with individual treatment. The mechanistic study demonstrated the ability of cationic NLC to disrupt the bacterial membrane, leading to protein leakage. The cell surface disintegration also increased oxacillin delivery into the cytoplasm, activating the bactericidal process.

The Sprague-Dawley rats were allocated to three groups which orally administered tanshinones (DST), polyphenolics (DFS), and a mixture of tanshinones and polyphenolics (DTF). These samples were processed by a simple liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) method with ethyl acetate. Chromatographic separation was achieved on an Acquity BEH C-18 column (100 mm x 2. 1 mm, 1.7 mu m) with themobile phase consisting of 0.1% (v/v) formic acid and acetonitrile by gradient elution at a flow rate of 0.4 mL/min. The detection was performed on a triple quadrupole-tandem mass spectrometer TQ-MS/MS equipped with negative and positive electrospray ionization (ESI) interface in multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode. The statistical analysis was performed by the Student's t-test with P <= 0.05 as the level of significance. The method showed good precision, accuracy, recovery, sensitivity, linearity, and stability. The pharmacokinetic profiles and parameters of these polyphenolics changed when co-administrated with tanshinones. The tanshinones improved the bioavailability of DSS, accelerated the eliminating rate of RA and Sal B and promoted their distribution in vivo. They also contributed to promoting the biotransformation of Sal B to DSS. The polyphenolics could affect the pharmacokinetic of tanshinones, especially CT and TSIIA.

In the present study, freshwater samples were collected and analyzed with respect to the total bacterial diversity and AR genes (ARGs) using both conventional culture-based techniques and a high-throughput culture-independent metagenomic approach. This paper presents a systematic protocol for the enumeration of the total and antibiotic -resistant culturable bacteria from freshwater samples and the determination of phenotypic and genotypic resistance in the culturable isolates. Further, we report the use of whole metagenomic analysis of the total metagenomic DNA extracted from the freshwater sample for the identification of the overall bacterial diversity, including non-culturable bacteria, and the identification of the total pool of different ARGs (resistome) in the water body. Following these detailed protocols, we observed a high antibiotic -resistant bacteria load in the range of 9.6 x 10(5)-1.2 x 10(9) CFU/mL. Most isolates were resistant to the multiple tested antibiotics, including cefotaxime, ampicillin, levofloxacin, chloramphenicol, ceftriaxone, gentamicin, neomycin, trimethoprim, and ciprofloxacin, with multiple antibiotic resistance (MAR) indexes of >= 0.2, indicating high levels of resistance in the isolates. The 16S rRNA sequencing identified potential human pathogens, such as Klebsiella pneumoniae, and opportunistic bacteria, such as Comamonas spp., Micrococcus spp., Arthrobacterspp., and Aeromonas spp. The molecular characterization of the isolates showed the presence of various ARGs, such as blaTEM, blaCTX-M (beta-lactams), aadA, aac (6')-Ib (aminoglycosides), and dfr1 (trimethoprims), which was also confirmed by the whole metagenomic DNA analysis.

KPC-1 had the highest affinity for meropenem, The kinetic studies also revealed that clavulanic acid and tazobactam inhibited KPC-1, An examination of the outer membrane proteins of the parent K, pneumoniae strain demonstrated that the strain does not express detectable levels of OmpK35 and OmpK37, although OmpK36 is present.

Here, the determination of the extent of SE, resultant accretion and emissions of GHGs like CO2, CH4, and N2O was quantified from the Sundarban mangrove ecosystem (SME). A Random Forest (RF) spatial model was proposed to predict the geographical distribution of GHG emissions throughout the Sundarban. Gas samples were gathered from the mangrove bed in 2022 using the enclosed box technique. Next, the Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission Digital Elevation Model (SRTM DEM), and Landsat 8 data were used to produce thematic inputs for the RUSLE model in a GIS platform. Both models were coupled to observe the match between erosion and GHG emission. The result showed that coastal most western part of Sundarban is prominent for CO2 (28.29-31.29 mmol m- 2 d- 1) and CH4 (0.281-0.329 mmol m- 2 d- 1) emission while N2O fluctuated more (0.137-0.169 mmol m- 2 d- 1) at central eastern part due to high deforested agriculture and aquaculture practices. The study revealed that the islands of Sundarban, located at the edge of the Bay of Bengal (BoB) have an increased risk of SE (>12 t ha- 1 yr- 1) as these islands encounter high oceanic water surges and cyclones yearly. The accuracy of the models were adjudged by the estimation of SE and GHG emission. The measured precision and area under the curve of receiver operating characteristics was 0.796 for RUSLE and 0.784 for RF models, respectively. An ""Automated Linear Regression (ALR) model"" showed that N2O was the most sensitive (Normalized Importance: 0.55) to erosion. Regression results showed association between GHGs and erosion were weakly correlated (R2 for CO2, CH4, and N2O were 54.79 %, 43.51 %, and 55.08 %). According to the ""Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model, rainfall and runoff erosivity factor (R)"" was the prime governing factor (normalized importance 100 %) for SE. The ""RUSLE model"" with ""Coupled Model Intercomparison Project-6 (CMIP6)"" ""rainfall data"", a ""Global Circulation Model (GCM)"" and the historical climatic data from 1960 to 1989 revealed the CO2, CH4 and N2O emissions would be 7.13 %, 39.25 %, and 38.18 % respectively by 2100. Accretion phenomena was more on the upstream regions of the Sundarban estuary.

This group of cycloprop-2-ene compounds exhibited significant analgesic activity, since 4% NaCl-induced abdominal constriction was reduced by 43-90% at 30 min, and 41-100% at 60 min, after drug administration relative to the reference drugs aspirin and celecoxib (58% and 32% inhibition at 30 min after drug administration) for a 50 mg/kg intraperitoneal dose. Al activities, determined using the carrageenan-induced rat paw edema assay, showed that this class of cycloprop-2-ene compounds exhibited Al activities in the inactive-to-modest activity range (0-26% inhibition) for a 50 mg/kg oral dose. The Al potency order for a group of 2,3-diphenylcycloprop-2-enes with respect to the C-1 substituent was oxime> hydrogen>carbonyl>benzoyl hydrazone. 2,3-Diphenyicycloprop-2-en-1-one oxime (20) was the most active Al agent, inducing a 26% reduction in inflammation, relative to the reference drugs ibuprofen and celecoxib, which showed 52% and 58% reductions in inflammation, at 5 h after drug administration. In vitro COX-1 and COX-2 inhibition studies showed that 2,3-diphenylcycloprop-2-en-1-one oxime (20) is a selective COX-2 inhibitor (COX-1 IC50>100 muM; COX-2 IC50 = 2.94 muM; COX-2 selectivity index>34). A molecular modeling study that docked the oxime (20) in the active site of the human COX-2 isozyme showed that it binds in the vicinity of the mouth of the COX-2 binding site with the O-atom of the oxime (=N-OH) moiety separated from the NH2 group of Arg(120) by about 3.65 Angstrom. This orientation of the oxime compound (20) in the COX-2 binding site could be due to a potentially strong ionic interaction between the =NOH oxime moiety and the guanidinium moiety of Arg(120).

In the group A there were 22 boars with the AS content up to 10%, in the group B 16 of boars with the AS content above 40% in collection I. Both groups were comparable concerning the parameters of the performance test results and in quantitative parameters of the semen from collection I. They differed significantly in the AS content (P < 0.01) and in the age (P < 0.05). In collection II in both groups the semen volume increased significantly (A - P < 0.01; B - P < 0.05), in the group A the number of spermatozoa per ejaculate and per day also increased (P < 0.01). In the group B there, was an insignificant clear decrease in the sperm concentration (P > 0.05). In comparison with the group B the group A can be characterized as a group with significantly higher dynamics in the sperm production per ejaculate. An opposite trend was noted in the total AS content. In the group A there was a significant increase (P < 0.001) and in the group B a significant decrease (P < 0.001) in collection II. In the group A there was a deterioration of the AS content in 7 boars (31.8%), in the group B an improvement in 7 boars (43.7%). Particular monitored AS forms are given. A significant difference in the total AS content between both groups was in favour of the group A (P < 0.001). While no boars from the group A exceeded the limit in the AS content for the applicability of semen for insemination (in the Czech Republic 25%), in the group B they remained above this limit without applicability possibility. The detected variations and prevailing stability in the AS occurrence in boars kept in the same conditions lead us to a consideration of hereditary characteristics of the spermatogenesis factor, of considerable persistence of the level of monitored characteristics and to a consideration of applicability of the phenotype AS presentation to selection of boars for artificial insemination.",,10.17221/4170-CJAS     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),boars;semen quality;morphological analysis spermatozoa;different development;SPERM MORPHOLOGY;SME-DEFECT;FERTILITY;AI,,,,,False,"The article focuses on sperm quality in boars and does not address the use of AI, ML, DL, ANN, or NN in SMEs or their impact on organizational performance and competitiveness."

The study of behaviour encompasses both social and engineering implications: on one hand the scientific goal is to design and represent believable models of human behaviours in different contexts; on the other hand, the engineering goal is to acquire relevant sensory information in real-time, as well as to process all the relevant data. The Chapter provides a number of examples of BMI systems, as well as discussions about possible implications in Smart Environments and Ambient Intelligence in a broad sense.        This chapter gives an introduction to the field of Behaviour Monitoring and Interpretation, BMI for short (Gottfried 2007-2009). The monitoring of behaviours and their interpretation is of interest in different areas; that is, in the natural sciences as well as in engineering disciplines. On the one hand, ethologists are interested in behaviours of humans and animals in order to gain insights into the nature of their character and evolution. On the other hand, engineers aim at automating processes, in particular those which involve behaviours of humans. Taking the technologies available in the first decade of the 21st century, it shows that many possibilities exist in order to support both ethologists in observing behaviours of humans and engineers in devising new tools to evaluate behaviours automatically. In fact, there is a trend which consists in connecting humans to electronic devices in order to record their behaviours. Furthermore, a broad community of cognitive scientists exists who approach problems in interpreting these behaviours in different ways; they involve computer scientists, engineers, psychologists, geographers, ethologists and many others who are all contributing with their specific discipline in making advances in behaviour monitoring and interpretation.        It is the goal of the present text to outline the research direction of behaviour monitoring and interpretation. This is to consolidate the different disciplines and their different methods in order to arrive at a common view on BMI. This includes the terminology and the components necessary of any BMI application.        The body of this chapter is structured in the following way. An initial example is presented in Section 1. It makes clear what BMI is about from the point of view of an application example. Simultaneously, a framework is outlined that derives from this example. It will be shown how other application examples fit into this very same framework in the following sections. Each of those following examples introduces typical facets of BMI systems: spatial scales are relevant in that each object to be monitored is found at a specific spatial scale (Section 2); direct and indirect observations are to be distinguished since objects are either directly observed or indirectly by means of changes that occur in the environment (Section 3); monitoring processes either occur in reality or in virtual spaces or in mixed reality scenarios (Section 4); behaviours are either purposeful and active, or they reflect typical everyday behaviours (Section 5); it can be distinguished whether a monitoring system works by means of deploying local or allocentric techniques (Section 6); eventually, similar as each application is found at a specific spatial scale, temporal scales are to be distinguished considering both durations and the speed with which observed behaviours are carried out (Section 7). A discussion section closes this chapter with a couple of issues (Section 8): different purposes of BMI applications are identified; their relationships to related areas, namely Ambient Intelligence (AmI) and Smart Environments (SmE) is discussed; the importance of AI methods is pointed out; ethical issues are considered. Finally, an outlook on future work is presented (Section 9).",,"[""10.4018/978-1-61692-857-5.ch021"", ""10.4018/978-1-61692-857-5     WE  - Book Citation Index – Science (BKCI-S)""]",PERSPECTIVES,,,,,False,"The article focuses on behaviour monitoring and interpretation in various contexts, not on the use of AI, ML, DL, or neural networks by SMEs for operational or competitive purposes."

Leveraging a novel conceptual framework, we integrate multiple layers of uncertainty-including regulatory, legal, and market-based factors-into an analysis of UK firms' strategic decisions in an open economy. Drawing on firm-level data from Bureau van Dijk's Orbis database and a synthetic control method, we estimate that Brexit uncertainty led to a 9.2% annual reduction in UK services exports, equivalent to a cumulative loss of USD 146.8 billion between 2016 and 2019. Our findings show that Brexit-related uncertainty disproportionately affected small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), while multinational enterprises (MNEs) were more likely to relocate operations outside the UK, exacerbating trade declines. This research highlights the critical role of transparent and predictable regulatory frameworks, risk management policies, and transitional support measures to mitigate the adverse effects of prolonged uncertainty. By identifying the specific mechanisms through which uncertainty shapes export decisions, this study offers key insights for policymakers aiming to foster resilience in the UK's services trade post-Brexit.        In recent years, the United Kingdom's decision to leave the European Union, known as Brexit, has created a cloud of uncertainty over its economic future. This uncertainty has been particularly concerning for the UK's services sector, which is a major part of its economy and includes industries like finance, IT (Information Technology), and transportation. While the impact of Brexit on goods trade has been widely discussed, less attention has been given to how it affects services exports. This study aims to fill that gap by examining the influence of Brexit uncertainty on the UK's international business activities, especially in the services sector.This study uses a multi-level empirical approach (research method based on observation and experience), combining firm-level data from the Orbis database with cross-border investment data. It looks at how Brexit uncertainty has influenced UK firms' decisions to participate in export markets, the intensity of their exports, and whether multinational enterprises (MNEs) have relocated their operations. The research is important because it provides insights into how policy-driven uncertainties, like Brexit, can affect trade and investment decisions in the services sector, which is crucial for the UK economy.The findings reveal that Brexit uncertainty has led to a significant decrease in UK services exports. Firms have been less likely to start exporting, and those already exporting have reduced their export intensity. Moreover, MNEs have been relocating their operations away from the UK, which has further contributed to the decline in services exports. The study estimates that the UK's services exports have been reduced by 9.2% annually since the Brexit referendum, resulting in a substantial economic loss.The research concludes that policy uncertainty, such as that caused by Brexit, can have a profound impact on international business activities. It highlights the need for clear and stable trade policies to support firms in making confident investment and trade decisions. The study's findings suggest that reducing uncertainty can help mitigate the negative effects of economic disengagement, like Brexit, on the services sector. Looking ahead, the research implies that the UK government and businesses must work together to navigate the challenges posed by Brexit and to find new opportunities for growth in the global economy.This text was initially drafted using artificial intelligence, then reviewed by the author(s) to ensure accuracy.        Cet article examine l'impact de l'incertitude li & eacute;e au Brexit sur le commerce des services du Royaume-Uni, en se concentrant sur la mani & egrave;re dont diff & eacute;rents types d'incertitude en mati & egrave;re de politique commerciale internationale (IBPU) influencent la participation et l'intensit & eacute; des exportations.
